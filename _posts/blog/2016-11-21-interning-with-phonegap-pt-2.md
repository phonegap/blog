## Intro

Hello! My name is Sterling, I’m an Aspiring Android Developer. I was ecstatic when I received an offer from Adobe to intern as part of the PhoneGap Team. It’s a unique opportunity for me because I’m a big believer in the importance of mobile development from a global and social perspective – PhoneGap enables anyone with access to a computer to create apps without prior knowledge of native, platform-specific programming languages.

## A little background

This is my first job in Computer Science, so I was not sure exactly what to expect on my start day. In my old life at a traditional engineering firm, I worked in a highly competitive & stressful environment which was draining for me and also not in alignment with my personality. I was pleased to discover that this team is nonhierarchical and truly collaborative. My teammates feel like friends who are eager to share ideas and coding knowledge. Its’ so refreshing! They have been extremely patient with me, especially given my comparative lack of experience. The PhoneGap team is really generous with the amount of time that they dedicate towards mentoring me. I’m starting to feel more independent now, but my “rev-up” time was considerable… I have noticed that instead of focusing on just individual productivity, everyone is in synch because they invest in the team as a whole. I believe this kind of working mentality is ultimately more efficient and also is conductive to a stronger product because everyone is working synergistically.

## Why I love it

I’m a single mother and I have a toddler at home so I am under lots of pressure. Before I started at Adobe I was really worried that I might be penalized because sometimes the logistics of parenting alone make it challenging to adhere to a regular 9-5 schedule. I was so relieved that the team is willing to be flexible with my schedule! It feels really good to know that being a mom is not going to interfere with my career growth as a programmer. Many of my teammates work from home and remotely.

I think it’s worth mentioning that Adobe employees are happy and healthy for a good reason. Adobe culture is very diverse and laid back, I feel comfortable being myself and don’t feel as though I need to conform to a certain “corporate mold” in order to be accepted by my colleagues. You can wear a nerdy t-shirt and jeans if you want to. I certainly do not miss my old stiff, formal business clothes! There is a seemingly endless parade of team lunches / dinners, gourmet adobe food (the cafeteria seriously resembles one of those Las Vegas buffets), snacks and catered happy hours. Last week we all went on a “field trip” to the Metreon to watch Dr.Strange on the Imax in 3D! Next week I am looking forward to attending the Adobe “ugly holiday sweater” party.

I feel so lucky to be part of this team and am looking forward to seeing how the rest of my internship unfolds

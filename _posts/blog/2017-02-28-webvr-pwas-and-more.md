We're about 3 months away from [PhoneGap Day EU 2017](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2017/) happening in Amsterdam May 18-19. Let's talk about what we have lined up this year.

## Speakers

We've got an amazing [lineup of speakers](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2017/) for PhoneGap Day EU. Some returning favorites and some new faces. *We'll be announcing more soon as well as the agenda and workshop schedule so keep an eye on our [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/phonegap)*

[Holly Schinsky](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2017/speaker/hollyschinsky/) will be returning to speak about Progressive Web Apps. She's giving a hands-on workshop where you'll learn to build an app that can run as both a PWA and a hybrid app with PhoneGap.

Also returning is [Kerri Shotts](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2017/speaker/kerrishotts/) who is a champion in the PhoneGap community. She'll be speaking about building a workflow that integrates modern JavaScript and PhoneGap. She'll also be giving a PhoneGap Plugin workshop. She's awesome.

Some new faces... [Joe Bowser](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2017/speaker/joebowser/) (one of the co-creators of PhoneGap who originally wrote the Android implementation) will be talking about WebVR and the basics of AFrame.

And it wouldn't be PhoneGap Day without a few frameworks. We're excited to welcome [Timo Ernst](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2017/speaker/timoernst/) to talk about building PhoneGap apps with Vue.js and Framework7.

## Workshops

We are running 2 tracks of workshops on Thursday, May 18th. Full schedule will be posted to the site soon, but here's a quick rundown of our workshop topics:

- App Privacy and Security for PhoneGap Developers
- Getting started with WebVR
- Cross-platform Progressive Web Apps
- PhoneGap plugin development
- PhoneGap push notifications
- App testing

Quick note. Workshops will be held in a different location than the conference. Join us at [Spaces Herengracht](https://www.spacesworks.com/amsterdam/herengracht/) for our workshop day.

## Extras

One of the best things about PhoneGap Day is the amazing people you get to meet at the conference. Most of the PhoneGap/Cordova team will be in attendance along with all the brightest minds in mobile development. So, as always, we'll have a networking mixer (with beer of course) after the conference - don't miss this chance to have some face-to-face time with the awesome PhoneGap community.

Lastly, we have some brand new swag for the event. And as much as we know you love the PhoneGap shirts... we have something special planned.

You don't want to miss this!

Have you considered porting your existing Android or iOS PhoneGap/Cordova app to Windows Store and or Windows Phone? Cordova support for Windows devices is permanently improving with regular contributions from Microsoft Open Tech and other Microsoft teams, taking advantage of native support for HTML5/JavaScript development on the latest versions of Windows and Windows Phone. During this workshop we will show you what the state of the art is and point out what the potential challenges are for you to port your existing Android or iOS PhoneGap app to Windows and Windows Phone Stores and give you access to a large set of new users with a minimum effort.

Big thanks to the Microsoft Open Technologies team for this great workshop and PhoneGap Day session.

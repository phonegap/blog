Google's Focus on Apache Cordova

Google's focus on Apache Cordova including Crosswalk for Cordova Android, Rapid Iterative Workflow, plugin development best practices, plugin testing, Cordova and Gulp, and the future of Open Web Apps.

Building a Chrome App for Android

Building an application using the Chrome Apps for Mobile toolkit, and you'll learn to use Google Cloud Messaging, create Rich Notifications, login with device Identity, and add offline storage. We'll also go through how to build a wonderfully fluid user experience using the Polymer project and Material Design, and create everything using HTML5 and JavaScript.

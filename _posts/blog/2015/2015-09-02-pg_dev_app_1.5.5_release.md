Hello everyone, we've released an important update!

## What’s New

We've greatly improved the autoreload speeds when you make changes to your app. This is especially helpful when dealing with apps with a large file size or have a large number of files.

## Install

Just make sure to [update the PhoneGap Developer App](http://docs.phonegap.com/references/developer-app/update-version/) to get these new and improved speeds! You will also have to update the PhoneGap CLI to the latest version (`5.2.2` or newer):

```sh
$ sudo npm install -g phonegap
```

or

```sh
C:\> npm install -g phonegap
```

## Upcoming Release

In our next release you can expect:

* Being able to load your app in your desktop browser

* Improved connection reliability

Thanks for using our app!

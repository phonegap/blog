A big thanks to everyone who was able to make it to PhoneGap Day EU 2015 in Amsterdam. We'll be posting more videos from the conference so check back on our [blog](https://phonegap.com/blog/tag/phonegap-day/) and [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PhoneGap).

Do you ever wish your users were more engaged with your app? Or that you could update its content more easily? In this session [Simon MacDonald](https://twitter.com/macdonst), Sr. Software Engineer at Adobe, covers best practices when it comes to push notifications and gives a great overview of the new, easier to configure and use Push Plugin and how to deliver content and code updates using the all new, all different Content Sync plugin.

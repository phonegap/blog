A big thanks to everyone who was able to make it to PhoneGap Day US. We'll be posting more videos from the conference so check back on our [blog](https://phonegap.com/blog/tag/phonegap-day/) or [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PhoneGap).

Our next session comes from [Paul Fischer](https://twitter.com/xmnboy), Technical Consultant, Intel Corporation.

The IntelÂ® XDK HTML5 is a free mobile app development tool utilizing a collection of open-source technologies to simplify the hybrid mobile app development cycle. In this quick survey of the tool he will demonstrate:

- Utilizing the Crosswalk webview for Android Cordova apps
- Build services for Crosswalk, Android, iOS and Win 8 Tablet
- App testing and debug with on-device debug and live preview
- Linking drag-and-drop UI widgets directly to RESTful web service APIs

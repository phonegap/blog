A big thanks to everyone who was able to make it to PhoneGap Day US. We'll be posting more videos from the conference so check back on our [blog](https://phonegap.com/blog/tag/phonegap-day/) or [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PhoneGap).

Our next session comes from [TJ VanToll](https://twitter.com/tjvantoll), Developer Advocate, Telerik and [Jennifer Looper](https://twitter.com/jenlooper), Developer Advocate, Telerik.

Building hybrid apps is hard. In addition to actually coding an application, you also have to deal platform-specific configuration files, icons, permissions, deployment procedures, and more. That's where Telerik comes in. With a series of tools—including cloud-based builds, dozens of high-quality (and free) Cordova plugins, and a whole lot more—Telerik provides everything you need to take the pain out of hybrid development.

In this workshop you'll build two complete apps: a photo album and a grocery list manager. You'll see how to tackle tough problems such as user management, authentication, and storing data in the cloud. Come learn how you can focus less on the platform-specific nuances of hybrid development, and more on building awesome apps.

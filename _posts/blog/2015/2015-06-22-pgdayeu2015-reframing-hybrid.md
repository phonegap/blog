A big thanks to everyone who was able to make it to PhoneGap Day EU 2015 in Amsterdam. We'll be posting more videos from the conference so check back on our [blog](https://phonegap.com/blog/tag/phonegap-day/) and [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PhoneGap).

Our next talk comes from the founders and creators of Ionic Framework, [Ben Sperry](https://twitter.com/benjsperry) and [Max Lynch](https://twitter.com/maxlynch). Historically, discussion around hybrid app development has focused on performance and native look and feel. While those are incredibly important topics, Max and Ben would like to reframe the conversation and focus on the ways in which hybrid development gives developers advantages over native development. They talk about how Ionic, PhoneGap, and other hybrid technologies give app developers abilities they never had before, resulting in apps that are faster and cheaper to build, more dynamic, and more successful.

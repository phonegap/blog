A big thanks to everyone who was able to make it to PhoneGap Day EU 2015 in Amsterdam. We'll be posting more videos from the conference so check back on our [blog](https://phonegap.com/blog/tag/phonegap-day/) and [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PhoneGap).

[Michael Brooks](https://twitter.com/mwbrooks) from the PhoneGap team kicked off the conference with this session, PhoneGap 2014 Review. He takes us through release cadence and the huge focus on continuous delivery for PhoneGap including 300+ releases over the last year.

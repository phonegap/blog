PhoneGap Enterprise is a new enterprise offering from Adobe providing the ability for both developers and marketers to optimize and speed up the delivery of engaging mobile app experiences across all channels. We went through the benefits of PhoneGap Enterprise in a [previous post](https://phonegap.com/blog/2015/01/23/phonegap-enterprise-post/) and we're working on some new features. We're continually trying to make mobile app development easier so here's a sneak peek at what's to come!

## Generate design compositions to create apps for PhoneGap Enterprise

Taking design to the web environment has traditionally been time consuming, resource intensive and something designers and developers have been challenged with since the inception of designing for the web. So what if we had the ability to take design compositions from within Photoshop or Illustrator (or any other design tool) and directly turn them into an app, website or email marketing with a one button click? Something that seems too good to be true doesn’t it? Well, maybe not.

To take design composition to the web and app environment is a tedious process and involves creating the design compositions in Photoshop or Illustrator, exporting the assets and design elements, then either the designer (who has learned to code) or a developer rebuilds the compositions with code within the development server which can take weeks. For design changes, many designers find themselves having to sit next to the developer to implement the altered design requirements to art direct the changes. D2W (Design to Web) allows a designer to take design compositions and turn them directly into an App with Adobe Experience Manager and Phonegap Enterprise with one click of a button dramatically simplifying the workflow.

For a designer, it’s as simple as creating their design composition in Photoshop and generating the design content with all functionality included with no coding required. The whole process to generate a design and create the app takes only seconds and, once in Adobe Experience Manager, content authors can then edit content and add additional components and publish.

This is the Holy Grail for any digital designer and for developers, sought after relief of trying to understand why moving that search field 5 px to the left is so critical. **We are currently in development therefore, this is not available yet but a tease of what to look forward to soon.**

See it in action!

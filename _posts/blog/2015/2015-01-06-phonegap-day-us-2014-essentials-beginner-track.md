A big thanks to everyone who was able to make it to PhoneGap Day US. We'll be posting more videos from the conference so check back on our [blog](https://phonegap.com/blog/tag/phonegap-day/) or [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PhoneGap).

Our next session comes from [Michael Brooks](https://twitter.com/mwbrooks) and [Anthony Rumsey](https://twitter.com/planetrumsey) from the Adobe team.

This workshop will provide an introduction to PhoneGap, the philosophy behind it and how to get started quickly using a variety of different tools available. The CLI, PhoneGap Developer App, PhoneGap Build and more will be shown and you will learn about the many frameworks available to choose from when building your mobile apps. You will also be shown debugging techniques and walk away with a solid understanding of what PhoneGap is all about. Lastly you can expect to hear an introduction to the PhoneGap Enterprise offering Adobe has been working on.

We had to release an emergency fix with PhoneGap Desktop 0.2.3.

We had an [issue](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/issues/553) where PhoneGap Desktop 0.2.2 would not connect properly with the PhoneGap Developer App.

From our investigation it looked like Electron 0.36.0 (used in PhoneGap Desktop 0.2.2) had some type of incompatibility with our code base. We found that Electron 0.35.6 worked fine with the PhoneGap Desktop 0.2.2 code base, so we had to roll back to Electron 0.35.6.

You'll need to manually update to 0.2.3.

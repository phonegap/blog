A big thanks to everyone who was able to make it to PhoneGap Day US. We'll be posting more videos from the conference so check back on our [blog](https://phonegap.com/blog/tag/phonegap-day/) or [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PhoneGap).

Our next speaker is [Mike Hartington](https://twitter.com/mhartington), front-end developer at Drifty and developer advocate for Ionic, taking us through a deep-dive look into Ionic Framework and how to implement it in your app development.

A big thanks to everyone who was able to make it to PhoneGap Day US 2016 in Lehi, UT. We'll be posting more videos from the conference (and the workshops!) so check back on our [blog](http://phonegap.com/blog/tag/phonegap-day/) and [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PhoneGap).

Our first speaker is [Eric Alli](https://twitter.com/_ericalli)</a> who gave some great tips to maintain a seamless development workflow.

Developing a complex and sustainable PhoneGap app can present many challenges. As your app grows, a seamless development workflow is crucial. Can you efficiently deploy and test in different environments? What are your pain points when implementing new functionality? How can you organize all the facets of your app with minimal effort?

Mind the gap focuses on some of the ways you can create a development workflow that automates these inefficiencies, boosts scalability and most of all, preserves developer sanity.

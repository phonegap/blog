Last week, we quietly released the PhoneGap CLI 6.2.0!

## Install or Update

You can install the latest version by running:

```javascript
$ npm install -g phonegap
```

Please checkout the [PhoneGap Docs](http://docs.phonegap.com/) for [detailed OS X and Windows installation guides](http://docs.phonegap.com/references/phonegap-cli/install/).

## Push Notifications

The main highlight of PhoneGap 6.2.0 is push notification support for the **PhoneGap Developer App**.  You can now test push notification functionality without needing to set up a Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) project for Android or an Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) certification for iOS.

### Sending pushes

When serving your app inside the PhoneGap Developer App you can use the new push command to send data to your application.

```bash
$ phonegap push --deviceID APA91bE1MmeTc92igNoi5OkDWUV --service apns --payload '{ "aps": { "alert": "Hello World" } }'
```

### Learn more about sending pushes

You can learn more about sending pushes by running the following help command:

```bash
$ phonegap push --help
```

For more detailed information please see the [Push Notification Developer Guide](http://docs.phonegap.com/develop/push-notifications/)

## Feedback

As always, PhoneGap is completely open sourced. Please [submit any issues, concerns, or feature requests](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-cli/issues) to the PhoneGap CLI issue tracker

Thanks for using PhoneGap!

A big thanks to everyone who was able to make it to PhoneGap Day US 2016 in Lehi, UT. We'll be posting more videos from the conference (and the workshops!) so check back on our [blog](http://phonegap.com/blog/tag/phonegap-day/) and [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PhoneGap).

Our next talk comes from the [Ionic team](http://ionic.io/). Ionic 1.0 has enabled many web developers to become mobile app developers. With the arrival of Angular 2 and its changes, and with ES6 being finalized, development has been improved yet again. How will that impact Ionic? In this session, weâ€™ll compare Ionic 1 and Ionic 2 and go over what we've learned, what improvements we're making to Ionic, and how easy it will be to develop apps with Ionic 2.

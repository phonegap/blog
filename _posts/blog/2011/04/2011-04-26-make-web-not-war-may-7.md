Hey Everyone,

I just wanted to do a blog post about a really cool event coming up on May 7th. Make Web Not War 2011 is happening in Vancouver, BC this year. Forget fighting about software and web development platforms — bring some love instead to the free Make Web Not War conference. Embrace mixed environments and open source harmonizing with commercial software. Learn about the latest tips, tricks and software from industry experts.

The conference focuses on open source applications and explores the newest web paradigms and technology, with everything from the Microsoft web platform, to Azure cloud, to PHP on Windows and even shiny new features in mobile. Make Web Not War is meant to join the gap between platforms, communities and developers.

Here’s three reasons to attend:

1. Meet with and chat with like-minded developers and share stories.
1. Learn from industry leaders and check out the panelists.
1. Fun. Video games. After party. Convinced?

Make Web Not War unites the gap between different platforms, communities, and developers of all trades and backgrounds. Last year’s event in Montreal was a huge success — this year’s conference in Vancouver will be even better.

These past few weeks I've been working on porting the [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com) framework to the [Samsung Bada](http://developer.bada.com/apis/index.do) platform.

Bada ships with a default [Webkit](http://www.webkit.org/) browser. It supports the [W3C geolocation](http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html) out of the box. The C++ SDK allows developers to instantiate a WebView (called Web Control in Bada) inside a Form (equivalent of a view in Bada). More info on Web control can be found [here](http://developer.bada.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.osp.apireference.help/classOsp_1_1Web_1_1Controls_1_1Web.html).

To port [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com), I got most of my inspiration from the existing [iPhone implementation](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-iphone). I use a similar technique on Bada.

### From Web to native

```js
document.location = "gap://com.phonegap.com.Accelerometer.getCurrentAcceleration"
```

The url gets intercepted by the WebControl and the command is then dispatched to the appropriate module (Accelerometer module in the case above).

### From native to Web

It does not seem to be possible to set the web control URL to "javascript:code" but there is a method that comes with WebControl that not only executes javascript code but also returns its result! The method is:

```c++
Osp::Base::String * EvaluateJavascriptN (const Osp::Base::String &scriptCode) const
```

That is really helpful for sharing data between Native/Web without overloading the URL with JSON/XML data!

The only downside is that it doesn't seem possible to stick an _alert();_ as it causes the Web control to hang. I still haven't figured out a way to do this. So right now you can't use alerts in your phonegap callbacks. I am still investigating the issue.

PhoneGap Bada supports: **Accelerometer, GeoLocation (Browser and Native), Contacts, Device, Network, Notifications, Storage (provided by WebKit), Events**

PhoneGap Bada does not yet support: Camera, File

PhoneGap Bada won't support: Media

Below is a screenshot of mobile-spec running on PhoneGap Bada.

The [Bada SDK](http://developer.bada.com) is unfortunately Windows Only and there are no plans to port it to other platforms. However, you can run it just fine on a virtual machine.

Code and instructions are on [github](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-bada). Check it out! Let me know what you think! Feedback good or bad is always welcome!

We're very excited that Adobe has now announced their support for PhoneGap! The gist of is it is now you can package your apps with PhoneGap and launch the iOS and Android emulators directly from within Dreamweaver. This version of Dreamweaver also bakes in support for jQuery Mobile which is one of the most popular frameworks used inside PhoneGap. I think this is awesome! This a big move forward for Adobe embracing mobile, open standards (HTML5), the mobile web and open source!

Scott Fegette, Dreamweaver Product Manager, has the most in depth [write up](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/dreamweaver/articles/whats-new-dwcs55.html) on it. Here's a snipit.

> For Android, the complex process of installing, configuring, and verifying the Android SDK has always been a bit of a chore. Dreamweaver CS5.5 takes all the pain out of this process by providing an "easy install" option, which will do all of the above for you in the background. Although the Apple iOS SDK tools are subject to a different licensing model (and only available on the Mac platform), once you've installed the Apple iOS SDK (or Xcode from the Mac App Store), you simply point Dreamweaver CS5.5 to the /Developer directory on your hard drive and you're ready to go.

Greg Rewis senior evangelist at Adobe also has a great [post](http://blog.assortedgarbage.com/2011/04/dreamweaver-wickedly-evolved/) on the topic and video explaining how it all works:

PhoneGap is all about making mobile app development easier and more accessible to broad audience of web developers out there do getting in bed with Dreamweaver is a great step in that direction.

One thing the Adobe folk don't promote as much as I think they should is the fact that web developers can call native apis like camera, contacts, notifications etc from PhoneGap now within Dreamweaver. That's at least as exciting as packaging for app stores:)

If this blog post seems a day late and a dollar short I apologize. I obviously new this functionality was coming out in Dreamweaver, but no one at Adobe told us they were launching yesterday:P Next time!

Be sure to check out the official [Adobe blog post](http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2011/04/introducing-adobe-creative-suite-5-5-product-family.html) for more info on new features in Adobe Creative Suite 5.5.

PS. Please excuse their typo on the opening slide of video. It's PhoneGap not Phone Gap. I'm sure it was just video production company who just didn't know what's up! :)

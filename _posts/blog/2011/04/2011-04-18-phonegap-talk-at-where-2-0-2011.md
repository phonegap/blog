[Dave Johnson](http://twitter.com/davejohnson) will be giving a [talk](http://where2conf.com/where2011/public/schedule/detail/17161) on HTML5 and PhoneGap the Where 2.0 Conf April 19 2011 in Santa Clara.

> HTML5 promises to pave the way for easy, device-neutral mobile app development. But, until HTML5 supports sophisticated cross-platform apps, developers are stuck building native apps for various mobile devices. Or are they?
>
> In this session you’ll learn how combining HTML5 with the open source PhoneGap (www.phonegap.com) framework bridges the gap between what’s possible with HTML5 today and the engaging mobile apps developers want to build. See how HTML5 and PhoneGap work together and learn how to expose device features outside of the existing HTML5 spec, such as camera.
>
> By learning to combine PhoneGap with HTML5, developers no longer have to commit to native development, nor do they need to wait for a mature HTML5 spec to build full-featured, cross-platform apps in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Track Dave and down to say hi or go for a beer if you have any burning PhoneGap questions:)

## Stealing Candy from a Child Isn't as Easy as it Used to Be

Don't get us wrong, we're not freaking out about the next generation of developers who will undoubtedly outsmart us and take our jobs, but the following story does make us think twice about how easy PhoneGap is to use. Even a kid can do it!

We know there are efforts underway across North America and around the world to teach young people programming languages. Occasionally we hear stories of young people designing iPhone apps and even breaking the top one hundred App Store list. With tools as easy as PhoneGap out there, we're bound to hear more of the same. Here are a few of our favourite stories of kids killing it with mobile apps, one of which was built using PhoneGap.

## Back Together Interactive

We recently heard from a mother who wrote to tell us her son had designed an app for a doctor and patients with back problems. Her son is nine years old. He used PhoneGap to develop "Back Together Interactive," an app for iOS that features techniques that aid in back pain.

Now, PhoneGap is easy. But this kid is obviously pretty smart. As developers, we should be seriously humbled by these next stories of two pint-sized brainiacs who built apps without the PhoneGap magic.

## Bubble Ball (Not to be confused with Seinfeld's 'Bubble Boy')

The Telegraph recently reported on 14-year-old Robert Nay from Utah who designed a game called "Bubble Ball." Downloaded more than two million times, Bubble Ball knocked "Angry Birds" from its number one spot as most downloaded app of all time, earlier this year. The iOS version, which went live in December 2010, has received particular attention and can still be downloaded for free.

## MathTime

Back in 2009, we read about Owen Voorhess, an 11 year-old boy and early adopter of app development. Owen developed “MathTime,” an app available in Apple's educational section. Mathtime is a game designed to help kids with their math skills. Owen teamed up with his nine-year-old brother who designed the symbols for the app using Photoshop and together, without any help from their parents, they pitched Apple.

## Our Future and Unemployment

If this kind of “child's play” keeps up, we might all be in trouble! Truth be told, we can learn a lot from how kids approach program language and build their own apps. If we arm them early with the tools they need to innovate, like PhoneGap, it might just be enough to change the world.

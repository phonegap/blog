Hey Everyone,

Last week, [RNAO](http://www.rnao.org/) was the top paid medical iPhone app in iTunes Canada. RNAO stands for the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario. The app was made using PhoneGap by [Nitobi](http://nitobi.com). It delivers professional development programs and also publishes the "Nursing Best Practice Guidelines". If you want to download the app on either iTunes/Android/BB check out [http://www.phonegap.com/app/rnao-nursing-best-practice-guideli/](http://www.phonegap.com/app/rnao-nursing-best-practice-guideli/).

Also, check out the case study about RNAO on the Nitobi website at [http://nitobi.com/casestudies/rnao/](http://nitobi.com/casestudies/rnao/) [![](/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-11-at-12.24.35-AM.png)](/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-11-at-12.24.35-AM.png)[![](/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-11-at-12.24.46-AM.png)](/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-11-at-12.24.46-AM.png) Cheers, -Steve

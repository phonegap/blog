<p><strong>Xcode 4 template specs are undocumented and buggy. So, there are issues</strong>:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>We cannot automatically include the "www" folder in the template - the user has to add it in manually (a quick drag and drop). I added in checks and warnings if users try to run the app without adding this in.</p></li>
<li><p>Some files, like .h and the -Info.plist file, are included in the 'Copy Bundle Resources' build phase by the template. No biggie during run-time, but for those with OCD they will want to remove these from the Build Phase (if only to get rid of the warning).</p></li>
<li><p>Because Xcode 4 does not expand tildes (~), I cannot add a reference to the PhoneGap.framework in the user's home folder, so I added it to a shared location /Users/Shared which has r+w permissions for everyone (the common folder /Library/Frameworks needs admin privileges). It was added here so users without admin privileges can still use PhoneGap.framework, and by extension, the Xcode 4 Template.</p></li>
</ul>

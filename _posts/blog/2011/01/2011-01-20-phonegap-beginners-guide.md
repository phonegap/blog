This past month my book on PhoneGap, [_PhoneGap: Beginner's Guide_](http://www.amazon.com/PhoneGap-Beginners-Guide-Andrew-Lunny/dp/1849515360), or _PGBG_, was published by Packt Publishing.

_PGBG_ helps developers new to PhoneGap get up to speed with writing PhoneGap applications. The book focuses on practical examples, rather than reiterating the [PhoneGap documentation](http://docs.phonegap.com), covering project structure and setup, HTML5/CSS3 techniques in modern mobile devices, and the PhoneGap APIs themselves. It should help you get PhoneGap apps up and running on all the major platforms.

Stay tuned to this blog and [my twitter account](http://twitter.com/alunny) for more updates - I'm hoping to get a dedicated site for the book up soon, with references for each chapters and notes on any changes to the PhoneGap APIs since publication.

Hey Everyone,

On June 8th, 2011, Shazron Abdullah ([@shazron](http://twitter.com/#!/shazron)) and Jesse MacFadyen([@purplecabbage](http://twitter.com/#!/purplecabbage)) presented about PhoneGap Build and the PhoneGap ecosystem at the [Bay Area Mobile Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/BayAreaMobile/).

Representatives from PayPal also presented on the [PayPal plugin for PhoneGap iOS](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/iPhone/PayPalPlugin) which was created by Shazron. Some attendees at the event had also created an [Android version of this plugin](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/Android/PayPalPlugin).

Videos of these three talks have now been released. If you are interested in viewing them, please click on one of the following links:

The event had over 100 attendees. It was sponsored by Samsung who also did a presentation on PhoneGap for Samsung Bada. Video for that presentation has not been made available yet.

Cheers,

Hey Everyone,

The guys over at [SproutCore](http://www.sproutcore.com/) have made a great blog post about how to get people up and running on using SproutCore with PhoneGap. You can check it out at [http://blog.sproutcore.com/sproutcore-and-phonegap/](http://blog.sproutcore.com/sproutcore-and-phonegap/).

SproutCore is a powerful JavaScript framework that is used to build some really slick web applications. It is open source and has a great community behind it. If you haven't checked out SproutCore before, definitely do so.

Let me know what you guys think of the guide and any related comments/suggestions below!

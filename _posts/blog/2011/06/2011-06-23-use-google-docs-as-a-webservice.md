Hey Everyone,

I came across this guide showing you how to use Google Docs as a simple webservice with PhoneGap. Not everyone can rent a webserver, so this might be the no cost solution you have been looking for!

You can read the post at [http://thepseudocoder.wordpress.com/2011/06/22/using-google-docs-are-a-webservice/](http://thepseudocoder.wordpress.com/2011/06/22/using-google-docs-are-a-webservice/). They are using [xui](http://xuijs.com/) to request the webservice data. Hope you find this helpful!

Cheers,
-Steve

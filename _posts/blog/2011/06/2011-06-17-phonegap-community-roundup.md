Hey Everyone,

There have been a lot of very cool articles popping up recently that are related to PhoneGap. I thought it would be a good idea to post some of them here to give them some more exposure and display some of the really neat things that are going on in the PhoneGap community!

[**Bridging the app gap**](http://www.pcpro.co.uk/realworld/367780/bridging-the-app-gap) Ian Wrigley discusses why he choose PhoneGap over native development and other design decisions in this great post over at PC Pro.

[**The Hacking Tyler, Texas, Project: Delivering the Beta**](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/06/the-hacking-tyler-texas-project-delivering-the-beta/240090/) This post is about Christopher Groskopf's attempts to open up the data of the small town in Texas to which he's moving. He dives into making a transit app for the small town.

[**Jesse Friedman on CNN**](http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/06/08/wednesdays-intriguing-people-58/) 9 year old Jesse Friedman was featured on "Wednesday's intriguing people" on CNN. Jesse Friedman is the creator of [Back Together](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/back-together-interactive/id424490056?mt=8), a app promoting back and neck care techniques.

[**Using PhoneGap in Eclipse to develop Android applications**](http://eclipseandjazz.blogspot.com/2011/06/using-phonegap-in-eclipse-to-develop.html) This is a good post for beginners about developing PhoneGap Android apps with Eclipse. It is written by Ayushman Jain.

I will be doing more posts like this one so we can really highlight some of these people doing great work in the PhoneGap Community!

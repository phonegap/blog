Hey Everyone,

On June 28, we will be having another online training event. This one will be focused on making a application from scratch using [Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/) and PhoneGap.

Sencha Touch is a mobile JavaScript framework for developing HTML5 web apps that look and feel native. It is built with web standards in mind. Check out [IGN Dominate](http://www.phonegap.com/app/ign-dominate/) to see an app made using Sencha Touch and PhoneGap.

If you are interested in attending this online training, please purchase one of the PhoneGap support subscriptions over at [http://PhoneGap.com/services](http://PhoneGap.com/services).

To find out more details about this training and future trainings, please visit [http://nitobi.com/training](http://nitobi.com/training)

Cheers,
-Steve

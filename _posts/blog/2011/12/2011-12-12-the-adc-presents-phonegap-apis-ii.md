Adobe Developer Evangelist [Kevin Hoyt](http://twitter.com/krhoyt) has released new videos covering more PhoneGap APIs. In these step-by-step videos he covers how to use the Connection, Contacts and Device APIs.

_* PhoneGap: Connection API_* - PhoneGapâ€™s Connection API can detect your mobile device's Internet connection. Kevin explains how to use this to your advantage when developing mobile apps.

**PhoneGap: Contacts API** - Kevin creates an HTML-based app that can access the contact list on your iOS or Android mobile device.

---

**PhoneGap: Device API** - Kevin employs the Device API in PhoneGap to get more information about the mobile platform on which the application is running.

We look forward to posting more of Kevin's videos soon. Missed his other PhoneGap videos? Check out his [intro videos](https://phonegap.com/2011/12/05/the-adc-presents-phonegap/) and his [other API videos](https://phonegap.com/2011/12/06/the-adc-presents-phonegap-apis/).

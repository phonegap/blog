The Adobe Developer Connection (ADC) is your source for technical articles and how-to videos that cover Adobe developer products and technologies. Recently, they launched a new PhoneGap series with Adobe Developer Evangelist [Kevin Hoyt](http://twitter.com/krhoyt).

The first three videos of the series give an introduction to PhoneGap as well as how to get started with developing PhoneGap apps for iOS and Android.

Hey Everyone,

Just wanted to let people know that we are having the next session of our monthly training program on Tuesday July 26, 2011\. We will be presenting an Intro to PhoneGap. We will walk over setting up your environment for iOS/Android development and creating a hello world app. If you are new to PhoneGap, definitely check this out!

To register for the event, you must sign up for a [PhoneGap support subscription](https://phonegap.com/support). You will also get access to our previous training sessions once you sign up. To view more information on the event, check out [http://www.phonegap.com/community/events/#2011-7-26](http://www.phonegap.com/community/events/#2011-7-26) and [http://nitobi.com/training](http://nitobi.com/training).

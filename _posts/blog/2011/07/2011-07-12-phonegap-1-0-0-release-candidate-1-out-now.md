Hey Everyone,

I got some big news! PhoneGap 1.0.0rc1 has been released today. You can go download it now from [http://www.phonegap.com/releasecandidate/](http://www.phonegap.com/releasecandidate/).

PhoneGap 1.0.0 is set to officially be released on [PhoneGap Day](http://www.phonegap.com/community/events/phonegap-day/), July 29th, 2011\.

Please take a look at our [release plan](http://wiki.phonegap.com/w/page/42000202/Release-Plan) to view a checklist of features that were updated/added. We would greatly appreciate if members of this fantastic community can download the release candidate and report any bugs you find on github. Follow the [wiki](http://wiki.phonegap.com/w/page/16494772/FrontPage#issue) for instructions on how to submit bugs.

I have included a file changes.txt into the download that shows commits from PhoneGap 0.9.6 to PhoneGap 1.0.0rc1\. View that file to see some of the changes our developers made.

Cheers,

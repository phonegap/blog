[NS BASIC Corporation](http://www.nsbasic.com/app/) announced that it now supports PhoneGap. That means apps created with NS Basic/App Studio get more power under the hood and additional APIs and functionality including compass, contacts, camera, files and notifications. These apps also become portable to platforms that support JavaScript, HTML5 and Webkit.

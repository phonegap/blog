[Christina Warren](http://twitter.com/#!/film_girl) just posted a good high level overview of how HTML5 is addressing cross platform dev for devices.

On PhoneGap:

> **PhoneGap** is an HTML5 app platform that lets developers build native apps using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. What really sets PhoneGap apart is that it lets developers create a full-functioning mobile web app but place that app in a native wrapper, so that it can use native device APIs and get submitted to the App Store or Android Market.
>
> In essence, it enables mobile developers to create an app just as if they were targeting the mobile browser but with the benefit of being able to get into the App Store.
>
> **PhoneGap Build** is a new service (still in beta) that lets developers quickly and easily create app-store ready versions of their apps for various platforms. It does all the work of compiling the code for various platforms and gives the developer a final build suitable for submission to the app market of their choice.

I don't really consider Titanium as an HTML5 solution but it does tackle cross platform dev.

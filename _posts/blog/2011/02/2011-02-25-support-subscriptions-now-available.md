Need PhoneGap tech support? Annual support subscriptions are [now available](http://www.phonegap.com/services/#matrix) for hackers, development shops and large enterprises.

Till now, PhoneGap app developers have relied on the public [Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/phonegap), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/phonegap) and [help docs](http://wiki.phonegap.com/w/page/16494772/FrontPage) for tech support. Training webinars have also been popular. Though these channels work well for some, the new paid support subscriptions guarantee a higher level of service.

PhoneGap support packages start at $249 and include:

* A minimum of eight webinars throughout the year.
* A private forum.
* Nitobi office hours. A day a week, we'll open IRC chat to answer your questions on the spot.
* Access to the PhoneGap Build beta.

A Pro license costs $5000/year and covers up to five developers on a team. Enterprise licenses are also available.

Check out the [PhoneGap support subscription packages](http://www.phonegap.com/services/#matrix) here.

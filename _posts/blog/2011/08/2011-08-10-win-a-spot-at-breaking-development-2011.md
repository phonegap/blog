The pass, worth $1545, gets you in to the conference and the full day of workshops!

The Breaking Development conference (held in Nashville, September 12-14) focuses on new, emerging techniques for web development and design for mobile devices. This year's speakers are hand-picked to make sure you get challenging, well-delivered talks from a variety of different perspectives. Our very own Dave Johnson will be presenting a workshop on [building native mobile apps with PhoneGap and HTML5](http://www.bdconf.com/workshops#davejohnson). Check out the rest of the [impressive speaker lineup](http://www.bdconf.com/workshops).

Here's how we're going to give away this coveted Breaking Development conference pass.

On August 24th we'll draw one lucky winner from the last 100 apps submitted. If you've built an app and haven't submitted it to the directory, now's the time. Get some attention for your app and get a chance to win a Breaking Development conference pass.

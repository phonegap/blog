Hey Everyone,

Over the next few weeks, we will be releasing all of the PhoneGap Day talks! The first video I am going to release is a talk by Bryce Curtis from IBM. He talks about IBM, PhoneGap & the Enterprise. You can view his slides at [http://www.slideshare.net/drbac/phonegap-day-ibm-phonegap-and-the-enterprise](http://www.slideshare.net/drbac/phonegap-day-ibm-phonegap-and-the-enterprise). Follow Bryce on twitter at [@drbac](http://twitter.com/#!/drbac).

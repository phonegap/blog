PhoneGap will be at Salesforce's annual user and developer conference ([Dreamforce](http://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF11/)) in San Francisco next week. Dreamforce is the cloud computing event of the year bringing together all the leaders in cloud computing to share, connect, and inspire. Naturally, it's right up our alley!

You can catch PhoneGap in three different places:

**Tuesday, Aug 30, 6:30-7:30pm** **Developer Theatre** [Brian LeRoux](http://twitter.com/brianleroux) will be leading an overview session of PhoneGap and Cross-Platform Mobile App Development.

**Wednesday, Aug 31, 5-6pm** **Open Source Lab** [Dave Johnson](http://twitter.com/davejohnson) will be in the [Open Source Lab](http://blogs.developerforce.com/reid-carlberg/2011/08/connect-with-phone-gap-in-the-open-source-lab-df11.html) helping users build a Force.com Mobile App in real time.

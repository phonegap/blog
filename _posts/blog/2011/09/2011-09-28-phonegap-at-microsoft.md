Come join our PhoneGap meetup at the Microsoft campus in Redmond, WA. on_* October 7 from 7-9pm_*. It's totally free!

This informal, fun meetup will feature an introduction to [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com/). See a hands-on tutorial showing you how to use your HTML/JavaScript skills to build applications for mobile platforms including iPhone, Google Android, Blackberry, Symbian and Palm.

In the second half, you'll see a demo of PhoneGap for Windows Phone 7. Nitobi worked closely with Microsoft to bring PhoneGap to WP7 devices and we opened up the beta in early September. [Jesse MacFadyen](http://blogs.nitobi.com/jesse/2011/09/08/pg-wp7mango/), Nitobi's Senior Developer, will give a rundown on how to get started and how it works.

If that wasn't enough, we'll be throwing in **free pizza, beer and even some XBox 360 giveaways.**

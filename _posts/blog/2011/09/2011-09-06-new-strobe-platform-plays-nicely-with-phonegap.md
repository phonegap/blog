Congratulations to [Strobe](http://www.strobecorp.com/) on its recent launch! Strobe is a new app platform and delivery network that helps developers build HTML5-based Web applications for desktops, smartphones and tablets, while centrally managing them from a single interface. The best part? Strobe has [PhoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com/) integration built in, which allows users to build for iOS, Android, BB, Symbian, and webOS without having to download all the necessary SDK's and IDE's.

Some highlights from Strobe:

* a single interface from which to manage apps deployed to various devices
* teams can easily manage code (both test code and production code)
* developers can configure the appâ€™s deployment across platforms (Web, Android, iOS, etc.), thanks to PhoneGap Build integration
* you can add additional services (social, push notifications, authentication, etc.)
* track analytics within an easy-to-use dashboard

Besides PhoneGap, Strobe also utilizes SproutCore, an open source JavaScript framework that allows developers to create web applications with a user experience comparable to that of desktop applications. All in all, this is good news for developers as Strobe's goal is to push a single experience across multiple platforms and devices.

Hey Everyone,

We’re stoked by the self-starter attitude in the PhoneGap community. With PhoneGap Meetups popping up here and there, we figured a mini PhoneGap Meetup organizer kit would be a useful tool. So, here’s everything you need to start a PhoneGap Meetup in your town. A meetup is a great way to connect with other PhoneGap fans and developers in your neighborhood, brush up on your app skills, trouble shoot your projects and brainstorm ideas.

[Check out](http://www.meetup.com/PhoneGap-SF/) what the members of the San Francisco PhoneGap Meetup have to say about their community.

Ways We Can Help

Nitobi can help kick start your meetup in three ways:

1. We'll sponsor your meetup listing on [meetup.com](http://meetup.com) for the first year (US $144)
1. We'll buy the first round of beers at your first event.
1. Use our ready-to-go online presentations that may help spark discussion at your meetup.

How else can we help?

If you’ve got questions about starting a PhoneGap meetup or are ready to launch your group, contact me (Steve Gill) at steve.gill@nitobi.com or [@stevesgill](http://twitter.com/#/stevesgill).

Continue to connect with the PhoneGap community outside the meetup space via Twitter using the [#PhoneGap](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23phonegap) hashtag and by connecting with [@phonegap](http://twitter.com/#/phonegap) or [@nitobi](http://twitter.com/#/nitobi).

Questions? We’d be happy to answer them. [Email](http://www.phonegap.com/contact) us or click here to learn more about how [meetup.com](http://meetup.com) works.

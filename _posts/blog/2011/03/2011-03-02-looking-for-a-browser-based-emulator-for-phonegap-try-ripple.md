The guys over at [Tiny Hippos](http://tinyhippos.com/) have been kicking ass on their mobile dev emulator [Ripple](http://ripple.tinyhippos.com/). It's a Chrome Extension that helps develop PhoneGap apps by simulating data from [PhoneGap APIs](http://docs.phonegap.com).

Check out this PhoneGap Geo demo in Ripple:

Can't wait to see what this crew does next! Check out their blog post on it [here](http://tinyhippos.com/2011/01/24/phonegap-geo-demo-app-in-ripple/).

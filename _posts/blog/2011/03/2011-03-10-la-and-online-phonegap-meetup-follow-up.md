Hey Everyone,

Last nights Intro to PhoneGap talk went quite well after some of the technical hiccups the group in LA were experiencing were fixed. I want to thank everyone who attended last night and the people who gave me some feedback.

Here are a few resources from last nights talk:

Check out the sample app I ran last night located at [https://github.com/alunny/pg-training](https://github.com/alunny/pg-training) If you are interested in doing our upcoming Basic and Advanced training sessions, checkout [nitobi.com/training](http://www.nitobi.com/training). If you want to download the presentation click [here](http://nitobi.com/presentation/introToPhoneGap.pdf). I want to thank [Brian Leroux](http://twitter.com/#!/brianleroux) for letting me use his slides.

If you are interested in doing a PhoneGap meetup in your city, or if you have any questions at all, feel free to email me at steve.gill@nitobi.com or tweet me [@stevesgill](http://twitter.com/#!/stevesgill)

Cheers!

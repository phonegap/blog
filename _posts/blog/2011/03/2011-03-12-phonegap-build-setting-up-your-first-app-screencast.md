Hey Everyone,

I made a screencast walking you through setting up your first PhoneGap build project. If you are interested you can view it at [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnjQLDIYG2A](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnjQLDIYG2A).

Hope you find it useful! Leave any feedback in the comments,

Cheers,

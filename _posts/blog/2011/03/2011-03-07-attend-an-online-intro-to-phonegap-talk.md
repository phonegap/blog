Hey Everyone,

This Tuesday, March 8th at 7:00pm PST, I am going to be doing a Intro to PhoneGap talk online for a iPhone & Android Dev meetup group in LA. The meetup group is sponsored by [The Bit Source](http://www.thebitsource.com).

The talk will do a basic overview of what PhoneGap is, demo a sample PhoneGap app running on iPhone and Android emulators and do a brief discussion on PhoneGap Build.

If you are located in LA and want to check out the meetup go to [http://www.iphonedevla.com/events/16046072/](http://www.iphonedevla.com/events/16046072/) and RSVP. If you donâ€™t live in LA and want to attend the talk online, click [here](https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/697839769) to register.

Any questions about the event in LA can be directed to [@msacks](http://twitter.com/#!/msacks). Any other questions can be directed to me at [@stevesgill](http://twitter.com/#!/stevesgill) or steve.gill@nitobi.com.

We have exciting news to share—we're being acquired by Adobe! Adobe has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Nitobi (including PhoneGap and PhoneGap Build). This was officially announced today at Adobe's MAX 2011 technology Conference in Los Angeles.

What does this mean for us?

This acquisition will allow Nitobi to focus solely on PhoneGap and work with Adobe to offer developers more efficient, expressive design and development across devices with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. By joining forces with Adobe, we'll be able to offer even more innovative applications across platforms and devices, with greater reach.

“Adobe has always been a big supporter of the open source community and at the forefront of enabling rich, web based applications across screens,” said Andre Charland, CEO of Nitobi. “We share the same philosophy about enabling extraordinary mobile and web applications. Becoming part of the Adobe family with its industry-leading tools and technologies opens up amazing new opportunities for PhoneGap and our customers.”

Another really exciting part of this is that we’re putting the PhoneGap code base in the Apache Software Foundation. See more about it in our ASF proposal [here](http://wiki.phonegap.com/w/page/46311152/apache-callback-proposal).

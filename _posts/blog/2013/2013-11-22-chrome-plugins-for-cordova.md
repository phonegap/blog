Thank you to everyone who attended [PhoneGap Day EU](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2013). We'll be rolling out all the videos over the coming days for those who weren't able to attend.

Our next speaker is [Andrew Grieve](http://twitter.com/grieveandrew), developer at Google, giving an overview of Chrome plugins for [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.io)

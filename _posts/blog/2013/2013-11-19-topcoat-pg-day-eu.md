Thank you to everyone who attended [PhoneGap Day EU](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2013). We'll be rolling out all the videos over the coming days for those who weren't able to attend.

Our next video is [Kristofer Joseph](http://twitter.com/dam), JavaScript Frameworks Lead at [Adobe](http://adobe.com), talking about [Topcoat](http://topcoat.io) and how to use it to create clean and fast apps.

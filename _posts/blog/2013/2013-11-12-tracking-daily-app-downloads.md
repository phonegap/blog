Thank you to everyone who attended [PhoneGap Day EU](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2013). We'll be rolling out all the videos over the coming days for those who weren't able to attend.

First up is [Vincent Hoogsteder](http://twitter.com/hoogsteder), CEO and co-founder of [Distimo](http://twitter.com/distimo), talking about tracking daily downloads and revenues from any app. Vincent shares Distimo's findings, including what is working for top-selling apps.

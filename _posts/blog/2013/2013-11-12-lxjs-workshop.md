At the end of September, the PhoneGap team travelled to Lisbon to attend and participate in [LXJS 2013](http://2013.lxjs.org). [Brian LeRoux](http://twitter.com/brianleroux) and [Christophe Coenraets](http://twitter.com/ccoenraets) co-hosted the workshop "Beyond the demos: Building Real-Life PhoneGap Apps". Thanks to the awesome LXJS organizers, we've got a recording from that workshop to share with you! Enjoy.

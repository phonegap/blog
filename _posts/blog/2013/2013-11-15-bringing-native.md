Thank you to everyone who attended [PhoneGap Day EU](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2013). We'll be rolling out all the videos over the coming days for those who weren't able to attend.

Our next video is Masahiro Tanaka, CEO of [Asial Corporation](http://www.asial.co.jp/), talking about the difference between HTML5 based UI and native component based UI.

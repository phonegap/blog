Thank you to everyone who attended [PhoneGap Day EU](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2013). We'll be rolling out all the videos over the coming days for those who weren't able to attend.

Our next video is [Ally Ogilvie](http://twitter.com/allyogilvie), Lead Engineer / Mobile Dev at [Wizcorp](http://wizcorp.jp), talking about using HTML5 for gaming and covers specific plugins and strategies they used.

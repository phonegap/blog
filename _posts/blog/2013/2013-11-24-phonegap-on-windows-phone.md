Thank you to everyone who attended [PhoneGap Day EU](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2013). We'll be rolling out all the videos over the coming days for those who weren't able to attend.

Our next speaker is [Ruud de Jonge](http://twitter.com/Ruudj), Director of Windows Phone Apps for Western Europe, giving an overview of Windows Phone Apps made with PhoneGap.

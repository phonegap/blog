Thank you to everyone who attended [PhoneGap Day EU](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2013). We'll be rolling out all the videos over the coming days for those who weren't able to attend.

Our next video is [Joe Marini](http://twitter.com/joemarini), Lead Dev Relations for Google, covering Chrome packaged apps and PhoneGap.

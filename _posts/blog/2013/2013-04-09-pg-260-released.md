We have just released PhoneGap 2.6.0! Thanks to everyone who worked so hard to get this release out.

In this release, the community mainly focused on bug fixes. View the 2.6.0 commits in the changelog on [GitHub](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/blob/2.6.0/changelog).

If you find any bugs with this version, help out our community and project by reporting them on our [issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB).

The [PhoneGap Build](http://build.phonegap.com) team just released 2.5 support and is already hard at work on supporting PhoneGap 2.6.0. Stay tuned.

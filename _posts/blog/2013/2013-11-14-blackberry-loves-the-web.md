Thank you to everyone who attended [PhoneGap Day EU](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2013). We'll be rolling out all the videos over the coming days for those who weren't able to attend.

Next up is [Jorge del Casar Sanchez](http://twitter.com/JorgeCasar), Developer Evangelist for [BlackBerry](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2013), talking about HTML5 support in BlackBerry 10.

Thank you to everyone who attended [PhoneGap Day EU](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2013). We'll be rolling out all the videos over the coming days for those who weren't able to attend.

Our next video is [Rob Lauer](http://twitter.com/rdlauer), Developer Advocate for [Telerik](http://www.telerik.com), talking about the most common reasons why hybrid mobile apps get rejected and what developers can do to avoid them.

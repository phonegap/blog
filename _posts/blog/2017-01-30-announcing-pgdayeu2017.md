It's that time of year again! The PhoneGap team is headed back to Amsterdam for [PhoneGap Day EU 2017](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2017/). Come join us and Cordova/PhoneGap community for a full day of hands-on workshops and a one-day conference May 18-19, 2017.

We've announced a few speakers and workshop topics over on the [PhoneGap Day site](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2017/) so hurry over and grab your tickets. There are still a few early bird tickets left.

## Workshops

There will be 2 tracks of workshops on Thursday, May 18th with great content running all day. We'll announce the full schedule soon, but we'll have workshops on things like:

1. Progressive Web Apps
1. Security
1. Testing
1. Virtual Reality

You don't want to miss these! All workshops will be given by seasoned PhoneGap experts so come ready to learn.

NOTE: The PhoneGap Day workshops will be in a different venue than the conference. Venue details for both listed on the [PhoneGap Day site](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2017/).

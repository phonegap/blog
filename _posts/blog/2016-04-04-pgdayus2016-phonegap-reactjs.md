A big thanks to everyone who was able to make it to PhoneGap Day US 2016 in Lehi, UT. We'll be posting more videos from the conference (and the workshops!) so check back on our [blog](http://phonegap.com/blog/tag/phonegap-day/) and [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PhoneGap).

[Jed Watson](https://twitter.com/JedWatson) joins us next to talk about using React.js with PhoneGap

React.js has been changing the way web developers build user interfaces for the web, but what about hybrid mobile apps, where jQuery Mobile and Angular remain the most popular frameworks? In this talk Jed will review the advantages and challenges of React for mobile, why it is an exciting framework to use, and how to integrate the React ecosystem into your development workflow.

Slides from Jed's PhoneGap Day talk available [here](https://github.com/JedWatson/picture-tour-app) or watch the video below.

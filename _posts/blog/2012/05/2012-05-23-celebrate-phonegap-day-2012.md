Last year, we hosted our first ever PhoneGap Day in Portland, Oregon and we're excited to announce that we're doing it again! On Friday, July 20th, we're hosting our second PhoneGap Day at [The LeftBank Annex](http://leftbankannex.com/) in Portland, Oregon.

PhoneGap Day is one part conference and one part celebration where you'll meet and mingle with other people who use PhoneGap as part of their mobile app development. We'll have tons of speakers covering the latest on PhoneGap and PhoneGap Build, tools, apps, and more. You'll get to meet the PhoneGap team and connect with other PhoneGap developers from IBM, Facebook, and many more.

And of course, what's a PhoneGap event without some beer? We'll be serving a catered breakfast and lunch with plenty of beer to go around.

At [OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012)? Stick around in Portland and join us! PhoneGap Day falls on the last day of OSCON, so come by for more great speakers and socializing with others like you who use and love PhoneGap.

Can't make it to Portland in July? We're also hosting **PhoneGap Day EU on September 14** in Amsterdam! Save the date and stay tuned for more details on that.

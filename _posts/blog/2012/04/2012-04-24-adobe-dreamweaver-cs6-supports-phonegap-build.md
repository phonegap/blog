We're really excited to announce the support of [PhoneGap Build](http://build.phonegap.com) in [Adobe Dreamweaver CS6](http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html)! By incorporating Build, users will have a more streamlined, up-to-date, and stable development environment.

Author HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript-based applications with ease. Log into PhoneGap Build via the PhoneGap Build Service Panel (Site > PhoneGap Build) and build your web applications directly in Dreamweaver CS6\. Compile and sign your applications in the cloud and download the resulting native mobile applications to your local desktop or mobile device. The PhoneGap Build service handles the compilation of native mobile apps for iOS, Android, BlackBerry, WebOS, and Symbian.

The benefits to using PhoneGap Build in Dreamweaver CS6 are:

* targeting more platforms than previous versions of Dreamweaver
* compiling against up-to-date SDKs without installing updates in a local environment
* a smoother development experience with quickly deployed patches by the PhoneGap Build team

Besides PhoneGap Build, Dreamweaver CS6 has a bunch of other cool features like jQuery Mobile 1.0 and jQuery Mobile swatches. [Learn more about what's new in Dreamweaver CS6\.](http://helpx.adobe.com/dreamweaver/using/whats-new.html)

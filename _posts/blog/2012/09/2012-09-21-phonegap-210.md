We have just released PhoneGap 2.1.0! Thanks to everyone who worked so hard to get this release out!

This release focuses on fixing existing bugs that arose after the last release.

PhoneGap iOS has been fully migrated to use Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). Checkout Shazron's blog about [changes in Cordova 2.1.0 for iOS](http://shazronatadobe.wordpress.com/2012/08/28/10-upcoming-changes-for-cordova-ios-2-1-0/) and [how to update plugins to work with ARC](http://shazronatadobe.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/automatic-reference-counting-arc-and-cordova-plugins/). PhoneGap also supports iOS 6 now.

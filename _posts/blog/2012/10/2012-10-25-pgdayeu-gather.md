Thank you to everyone who attended [PhoneGap Day EU](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2012/) and made it such a huge success. We're sharing videos from the event for those of you who weren't able to attend.

Our next video is from [Max Ogden](http://twitter.com/maxogden), who presented about building Gather.at at PhoneGap Day EU. Gather.at is a PhoneGap app for iOS and Android that is built to help bring people together at public gatherings. You can view the recording from PhoneGap Day EU below!

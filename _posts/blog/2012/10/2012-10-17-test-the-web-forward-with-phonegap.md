Hello there, we may have already met, but let me introduce myself. My name is [Michael Brooks](http://twitter.com/mwbrooks) and I'm a core contributor to [PhoneGap](https://phonegap.com) and [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.io). I'm going to take a stab in the dark and bet that you're a PhoneGap and mobile application developer. Together we make a pretty awesome team.

Let me tell you why.

We share the same headaches. As a web developer, one of your main pain-points is likely browser incompatibility. This is one of our main problems too. The PhoneGap team is constantly uncovering browser functionality quirks from your bug reports. These bugs are platform specific, device specific, and sometimes even carrier specific. Since we don't have browser logs, we must rely on your observation skills and the details of your bug report. This means bugs that are difficult to find, reproduce, and fix with a cross-platform solution.

As a web developer, you may feel powerless to fix browser incompatibilities.

Thankfully, you're wrong.

[Move the Web Forward](http://movethewebforward.org) is an initiative that empowers you, the web developer, to improve the web and the browsers that access it. From _Move the Web Forward_ was born a sub-project called [Test the Web Forward](http://testthewebforward.org). As a developer, this should resonate well with you since good tests are the sure cure to improved compatibility and reduced regression.

_Test the Web Forward_ is happening in [Paris, France on October 26-27th, 2012](http://testthewebforward.org/paris-2012.html). Along with experts from W3C, Mozilla, Opera, Google, and Microsoft, there will also be folks from Adobe and PhoneGap. We're attending to spread the word that PhoneGap is an incredible browser to test the future of the web today.

Everyone is welcome to join us at the event. [Registration is free](http://testtwfparis.eventbrite.com/) and the event should not conflict with your work schedule. While attending, you'll have the chance to chat with the experts and hack on code that will help improve the web for everyone!

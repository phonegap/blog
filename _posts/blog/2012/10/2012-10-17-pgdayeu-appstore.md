Thank you to everyone who attended [PhoneGap Day EU](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2012/) and made it such a huge success. We're sharing videos from the event for those of you who weren't able to attend.

Our fourth video is from [Distimo's](http://www.distimo.com/) Gert Jan Spriensma, who presented about the app store opportunity at PhoneGap Day EU. He speaks about techniques Distimo are using to collect data about all of the various app stores and why these metrics matter to you. You can view the slides from the presentation on [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/phonegap/the-appstore-opportunity-by-gert-jan-spriensma-phonegap-day-eu-sept-14-2011) and view the recording from PhoneGap Day EU below!

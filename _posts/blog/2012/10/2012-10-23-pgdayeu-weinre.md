Thank you to everyone who attended [PhoneGap Day EU](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2012/) and made it such a huge success. We're sharing videos from the event for those of you who weren't able to attend.

Our fifth video is from [IBM's](http://www.ibm.com/) [Pat Mueller](https://twitter.com/pmuellr), who presented about Weinre at PhoneGap Day EU. He speaks about debugging your PhoneGap application and how weinre can help. You can view the slides from the presentation on [his site](http://muellerware.org/papers/pgday-2012-eu/#1) and view the recording from PhoneGap Day EU below!

Thank you to everyone who attended [PhoneGap Day EU](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2012/) and made it such a huge success. Here's the next highlight video for those of you who weren't able to attend.

Our next video is from [Ian Jorgensen](http://twitter.com/ianjorgensen) who intrigued the audience with his title "What do Phonegap, Canvas and Urine have in Common?". It turns out that the answer is "Quite a lot!". Ian participated in Health Hackday in Stockholm which is a 24-hour competition to create an app related to healthcare. Ian's talk covers how they used PhoneGap to create [Piddle](http://www.linehq.com/piddle), an app that helps people with urine analysis.

There are no slides from Ian's presentation but view the recording from PhoneGap Day EU below and check out his app [Piddle](http://www.linehq.com/piddle).

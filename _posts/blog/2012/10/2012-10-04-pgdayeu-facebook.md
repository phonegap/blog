Thank you to everyone who attended [PhoneGap Day EU](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2012/) and made it such a huge success. We have decided to highlight each video for those of you who weren't able to attend.

Our second video is from [Facebook's](http://facebook.com) [Simon Cross](http://twitter.com/sicross), who presented about the state of mobile at Facebook at PhoneGap Day EU. He speaks about some very interesting mobile stats from Facebook and addresses the comments made by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Watch the video to find out why Facebook decided to switch their application from HTML to native and why HTML is still a fantastic choice for building applications. You can view the slides from the presentation on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/u/sicross/p/phonegap-day-eu-2012) and view the recording from PhoneGap Day EU below!

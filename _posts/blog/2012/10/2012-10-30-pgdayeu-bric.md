Thank you to everyone who attended [PhoneGap Day EU](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2012/) and made it such a huge success. We're sharing videos from the event for those of you who weren't able to attend.

Our next video is from [Joe McCann](http://twitter.com/joemccann), who presented on how to enter emerging markets for mobile at PhoneGap Day EU. Joe talks about how important it is to target emerging markets, especially BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China). You can view the slides from the presentation on [Joe's Dropbox](http://bit.ly/bric-mobile) and view the recording from PhoneGap Day EU below!

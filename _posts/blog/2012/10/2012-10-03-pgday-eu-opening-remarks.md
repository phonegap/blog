<p>Thank you to everyone who attended <a href="http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2012/">PhoneGap Day EU</a> and made it such a huge success. We have decided to highlight each video for those of you who weren't able to attend.</p>

<p>Our first video is from Adobe's <a href="http://twitter.com/andrecharland">Andre Charland</a>, who gave the opening remarks for the first ever PhoneGap Day EU. He speaks about some stats from PhoneGap.com including the fact we have had over 10 million unique visitors! He also covers the transition into Apache under the name of Apache Cordova, and how the project is thriving in its new home. You can view the slides from the presentation on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AndreCharland/phonegap-day-eu-2012-welcome">SlideShare</a> and view the recording from PhoneGap Day EU below!</p>

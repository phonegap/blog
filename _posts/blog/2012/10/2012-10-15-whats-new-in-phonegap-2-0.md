Thank you to everyone who attended [PhoneGap Day EU](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2012/) and made it such a huge success. Here's the next highlight video for those of you who weren't able to attend.

Our very own [Dave Johnson](http://twitter.com/davejohnson) discusses what's new in PhoneGap 2.0, which was released July 20, 2012\. He touches on a variety of topics including the move into the Apache Software Foundation, documentation, new platforms, embedded webview, plugins, and CLI. There's also a bonus Q&A period after Dave's talk (kicking in at around the 9-min mark) including questions about native sound, large databases, plugin information, Weinre and Windows Phone, and more.

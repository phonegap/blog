Thank you to everyone who attended [PhoneGap Day EU](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2012/) and made it such a huge success. We have decided to highlight each video for those of you who weren't able to attend.

Our fourth video is from [Intel's](http://www.intel.com/) [Paul Plaquette](https://github.com/pplaquette), who presented about porting Cordova to Tizen at PhoneGap Day EU. He speaks about why Intel decided to include the Tizen platform into Cordova and the work that was required to do it. You can view the recording from PhoneGap Day EU below!

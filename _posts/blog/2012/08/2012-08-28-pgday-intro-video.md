[PhoneGap Day US](http://pgday.phonegap.com/us2012/) was a huge success thanks to all of the speakers and attendees. To not lose the memory of this great event, we decided to film all of the sessions and have decided to release those videos for free to our wonderful community!

We will be releasing some videos every few days leading up to [PhoneGap Day EU](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2012/) happening on September 14th in Amsterdam. Our first release includes the opening remarks at PhoneGap Day US by [Andre Charland](https://twitter.com/AndreCharland) and an overview of the mobile web landscape by [Matt Kelly](https://twitter.com/mattwkelly). You can view the videos below or by going to our [Youtube Page](http://youtube.com/phonegap).

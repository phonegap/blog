We have just released PhoneGap 1.8.1\. This latest patch addresses a critical bug found on iOS which caused PhoneGap apps to crash. Please visit our [issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-885) to view the details of the problem.

If you are affected by this bug, please feel free to download the latest version of PhoneGap by clicking the Download button at the top of this page. You can also download earlier versions PhoneGap from [Github](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/tags).

Thanks to the PhoneGap/Apache Cordova Community for addressing this issue so quickly!

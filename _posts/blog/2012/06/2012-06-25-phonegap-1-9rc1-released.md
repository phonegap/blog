We have just released the first release candidate (RC) for [PhoneGap 1.9.0](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/zipball/1.9.0rc1)! This version of PhoneGap is composed mainly of bug fixes and the addition of Cordova webview for Android.

Cordova webview (Cleaver on iOS) allows integration of phonegap, as a view fragment, into a bigger native application.

For those of you wanting to be a step ahead, download and run 1.9.0rc1 on your machines. If you find any bugs with this version, help out the community and project by reporting them on our [issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB). Rest assured, we only tag a release candidate if we are happy with where the code is.

We'll continue to provide our latest release, PhoneGap 1.8.1, as the main download in our top nav and stay tuned for the official 1.9.0 release in the coming days!

**Looking for older versions of PhoneGap?** Download PhoneGap 1.8.0 and earlier from [Github](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/tags).

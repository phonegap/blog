We’re excited to announce that Adobe PhoneGap was named Best Cross-Platform Development Tool by [CodeProject’s 2012 Members Choice Awards](http://www.codeproject.com/PressReleases/5777/CODEPROJECT-ANNOUNCES-FOURTH-ANNUAL-MEMBERS-CHOICE.aspx)! CodeProject, one of the world’s largest independent online developer communities, present awards to the best development products and tools based on votes by their members. [![](/uploads/2012/06/awards-code-project-2012.png)](/uploads/2012/06/awards-code-project-2012.png) CodeProject.com members were asked to nominate and rate their favourite products and CodeProject editors compiled the highest rated listings. The results reflect products that developers value most and members chose which companies or products deserve recognition, based on in-the-field experience.

According to Jeff Hadfield, president of CodeProject (USA), “While development needs and platforms change, developers still need quality tools to get the job done. In fact, as platforms diversify, quality tools are more essential than ever before. The Code Project Members Choice Awards reflect the diversity and depth of developer tools. Congratulations to the award winners, and to the development community for encouraging innovation and excellence.”

"We're incredibly proud to receive this award, especially since it comes from our fellow developers," said Andre Charland, Adobe’s director of engineering for PhoneGap. "Since we're an open source project with many contributors, this is definitely a win for the whole community."

Great work everyone and thank you!

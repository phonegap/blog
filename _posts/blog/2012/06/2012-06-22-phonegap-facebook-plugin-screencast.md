Last night the [San Francisco PhoneGap Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/PhoneGap-SF/) featured Christine Abernathy, a Partner Engineer at Facebook. She presented on the Facebook Platform and how to use it in your PhoneGap apps.

We've updated the PhoneGap Facebook plugin to work with PhoneGap 1.8.1\. Try it for yourself! You can download the plugin on [Github](https://github.com/davejohnson/phonegap-plugin-facebook-connect).

I've created two new screencasts for installing the plugin on Android and iOS. Follow along and let us know how you do.

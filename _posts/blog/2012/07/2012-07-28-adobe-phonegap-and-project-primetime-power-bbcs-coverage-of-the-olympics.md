We’re excited to [announce](http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/201207/072612AdobeBBCOlympics.html) that the BBC is leveraging key components of [Project Primetime](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/project-primetime.html) in their live and video on demand (VOD) coverage of the London Games. The content is being delivered through a new, HTML5 [app](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18810308) built with Adobe PhoneGap, Adobe's tools and framework for creating cross-platform HTML5 apps for smartphones and tablets. The app is currently available for iOS and Android. Regional restrictions apply.

Check out some other apps made with PhoneGap on our [apps page](https://phonegap.com/app).

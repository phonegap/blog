We have just released the first release candidate (RC) for [PhoneGap 2.0.0](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/zipball/2.0.0rc1). We're really excited about this major milestone for the PhoneGap project! A changelog can be found within the download.

For those of you wanting to be a step ahead, download and run 2.0.0rc1 on your machines. If you find any bugs with this version, help out the community and project by reporting them on our [issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB). Rest assured, we only tag a release candidate if we are happy with where the code is.

We'll continue to provide our latest release, PhoneGap 1.9.0, as the main download in our top nav and stay tuned for the official 2.0.0 release on Friday on [PhoneGap Day](http://pgday.phonegap.com/us2012/)! (There are still [tickets](https://phonegapdaypdx.eventbrite.com/) available if you want to join us).

**Looking for older versions of PhoneGap?** Download PhoneGap 1.8.1 and earlier from [Github](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/tags).

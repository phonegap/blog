We're back from Portland after celebrating our 2nd annual PhoneGap Day US!  It was great to come together to officially release Adobe PhoneGap 2.0, see the latest and greatest from [PhoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com/), and of course, drink beers with the community.

And what a day it was for the community! It was our largest and most successful PhoneGap Day with over 230 people attending and countless conversations that have been continuing since July 20th.

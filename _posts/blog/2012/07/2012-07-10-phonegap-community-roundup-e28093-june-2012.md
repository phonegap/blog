Two months ago we started the [PhoneGap Community Release Notes](https://phonegap.com/2012/05/18/phonegap-community-release-notes/). Thank you to everyone who contributed. If you're organizing a PhoneGap event, speaking on PhoneGap or writing a blog post, please add it to the release notes on [Github](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-community).

We'll be posting the round up from each month and below is the roundup for the month of June.

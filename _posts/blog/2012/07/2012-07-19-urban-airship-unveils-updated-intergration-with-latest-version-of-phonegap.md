Tomorrow at PhoneGap Day, [Urban Airship](http://www.urbanairship.com/) is demonstrating its updated integration with the latest version of PhoneGap that enables developers to easily add the full push messaging capabilities of the world’s most globally deployed platform to their iOS and Android apps. Push messaging done right can [double audience engagement and retention](http://visit.urbanairship.com/l/7122/2012-07-09/bgvmw/7122/75096/Good_Push_Index.pdf), and with Urban Airship’s platform these messages can be targeted using a combination of user preferences, in-app behaviors and location history.

Integration is simple and seamless with drop-in Urban Airship client libraries that can be integrated natively with PhoneGap to use its UI and application logic, or utilized through new Urban Airship Android and iOS plugins. With PhoneGap’s focus on web programming languages to create hybrid mobile apps, Urban Airship’s client libraries are wrapped in a JavaScript API to require as little native code as possible.

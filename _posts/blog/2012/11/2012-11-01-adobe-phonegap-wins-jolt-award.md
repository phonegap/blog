Adobe PhoneGap has received a Jolt Award for best mobile development tool by Dr. Dobb's!

Since 1991, the Dr. Dobb's Jolt Awards have been presented annually to recognize products that have "jolted" the industry with their significance and made the task of creating software faster, easier and more efficient. Selected from a large field of nominees, the Jolt judges chose six top products in the mobile development tools category and narrowed down three semi-finalists, two Jolt Productivity Award winners, and the Jolt Award for the top product. We're stoked to be awarded the top spot!

>"The big idea of PhoneGap is that someday these standards will be widely supported by every mobile browser and the code you write for PhoneGap will continue to work without PhoneGap -- a hope expressed nicely by creators of PhoneGap, who have said that "the ultimate purpose of PhoneGap is to cease to exist." Because of the quality of implementation, the thoughtful design, support for so many platforms, and an automated cloud-based build service, the Jolt Award goes to Adobe PhoneGap."

We are extremely proud of our team and share this Jolt award with the entire community. “We have a large community contributing to PhoneGap and we gladly share this award with them. Without their efforts, PhoneGap wouldn't be making such impressive strides in the industry," said Andre Charland, Adobe’s Director of Product Management for PhoneGap.

We have just released PhoneGap 2.2.0! Thanks to everyone who worked so hard to get this release out!

In this release we are proud to announce support for [Windows 8](http://windows.microsoft.com/).  You can now take your PhoneGap apps to the Windows Store, and reach newly released Windows 8 and Windows RT devices.

Huge commits from the Intel open source team at [01.ORG](http://www.01.ORG) made this all possible.

For those of you wanting to develop apps for Windows Phone 8, we’re hard at work on that and it will be coming soon.

PhoneGap 2.2.0 also includes improvements to both the iOS and Android JavaScript to Java bridges. Your code will now execute 15-25 times faster than our old bridges!

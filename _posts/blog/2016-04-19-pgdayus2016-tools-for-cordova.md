A big thanks to everyone who was able to make it to PhoneGap Day US 2016 in Lehi, UT. We'll be posting more videos from the conference (and the workshops!) so check back on our [blog](http://phonegap.com/blog/tag/phonegap-day/) and [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PhoneGap).

Big thanks to Microsoft for sponsoring PhoneGap Day US 2016! And an even bigger thanks to [Ryan J Salva](https://twitter.com/ryanjsalva) for joining us and giving a great overview of development around the Cordova ecosystem.

Ryan talks about all the cool stuff happening around Cordova and how it affects all of us. It's a great time to celebrate because over the last 3 years Cordova/PhoneGap has doubled in usage and outpaced every other competitor when it comes to cross-platform development. Whoa!

Ryan also demos VS Code tools for Cordova and introduces Project Ace for leveraging native UI in Cordova apps.

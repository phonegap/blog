PhoneGap Desktop 0.3.0 is here!

A major feature has been added to PhoneGap Desktop. We've added Browser Platform support; which means you now have the option to preview your projects in the web browser on your computer.

We also managed to fix a few bugs and add some small enhancements:

- keyboard shortcuts for creating a new project, adding an existing project & quitting PhoneGap Desktop
- server address will launch your browser with the project being served

For a full list of changes made, see the CHANGELOG below.

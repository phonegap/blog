A big thanks to everyone who was able to make it to PhoneGap Day US 2016 in Lehi, UT. We'll be posting more videos from the conference (and the workshops!) so check back on our [blog](https://phonegap.com/blog/tag/phonegap-day/) and [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PhoneGap).

Our next talk comes from [Dean Haddock](https://twitter.com/systemconscious) who shares the story behind the incredible StoryCorps app, from early prototypes to the TED Prize and beyond.

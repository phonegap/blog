We just wrapped up PhoneGap Day US 2016 in Lehi, UT! It was an incredible few days and we can't wait to do it again.

With our sold out workshops and conference the Adobe Lehi office was bursting at the seams with hundreds of mobile developers and speakers from around the world.

## Day 1

We kicked off the workshop day with 3 separate tracks so attendees could choose their own adventure whether they wanted to learn more about plugin development or app submission best practices.

[Michael Brooks](https://twitter.com/mwbrooks) kicked off PhoneGap Day US 2016 with the history of PhoneGap Day, looking back on 2015 with Cordova and PhoneGap and looking forward to what's to come in 2016.

## PhoneGap Paris meetup

It was great to see our Paris community at the [PhoneGap Paris meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PhoneGap-Paris/). Big thanks to meetup organizer, [Julien](https://twitter.com/revolunet) and for [Talent.io](https://www.talent.io/) for hosting us (coolest office space).

Simon kicked things off with [What's new in Apache Cordova/PhoneGap](http://slides.com/simonmacdonald/deck-6-9-10-12#/) and introduced the new Creative SDK PhoneGap plugins as well. We introduced all the current Creative SDK plugins (and some ready-to-use templates) in this [post](https://phonegap.com/blog/2016/09/07/phonegap-csdk-plugin-roundup/). Anis then presented [Hybrid Android Development with PhoneGap](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t_Ir_hP34ha-g2UF3SWaY4f_UnGQ8vFbpUNI2pZB6yA/edit#slide=id.p).

## DevRelCon

DevRelCon was Dec 7th in London and some of our team attended. It was great to see all the work being done in the Dev Relations and Dev Evangelism side of the world. It was great hearing expert's perspective on the difference between developer evangelism and developer marketing, and also how to measure developer relations' success (hint: it's really really hard). Talk links haven't been posted yet, but keep an eye on the [DevRelCon event site](http://london-2016.devrel.net/) for those to be posted soon.

## Ionic UK meetup

We spent the evening with our good friends at Ionic and all the great members of [Ionic UK](https://www.meetup.com/Ionic-UK/). The crowd was great and super engaged as we're all fans of hybrid development. Big thanks to [Sani Yusuf](https://twitter.com/saniyusuf) for organizing everything. Simon and Anis gave similar talks as they did for PhoneGap Paris and we heard from one of the community members during the "spotlight" section of the night. This spotlight time is when anyone from the group can demo something their working on and get feedback. Great idea for future meetups!

## Women Who Code workshop

We ended the trip with the impressive Women Who Code London group. It was truly a pleasure meeting with all the diverse and talented women that are part of this organization. We spoke to students who are learning to code as a hobby and engineers at large companies. Simon walked us through a PhoneGap beginner workshop using the sample app template built by the PhoneGap team, [Star Track](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-star-track/). If you haven't given the sample app a whirl yet, do so now! Check out Simon's workshop [here](https://macdonst.github.io/wwc-london-star-track/).

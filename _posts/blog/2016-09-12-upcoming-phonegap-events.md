The PhoneGap team is going on the road over the next few months and you should come join us. We're going to be presenting at a few conferences and hosting some awesome local meetups. If you're going to be in the area, we'd love to see you!

## Adobe Open Source Summit 2016 - Today!

So, okay, this event is happening right now (as I'm typing this) and it's internal Adobe employees only. So you probably can't join us, but it's worth a quick shout out.

The goal of the Adobe Open Source Summit is to bring together developers across Adobe to foster and recognize open source initiatives and projects at Adobe.

The PhoneGap team is instrumental in helping encourage and expand open source across Adobe and is giving some awesome presentations today. We'll post links to the recordings later:

![Launch Pad at Web 2.0 Expo](http://assets.en.oreilly.com/1/event/22/webexsf2009_launchpad_logo.gif)The whole team at Nitobi is honored to have been [picked as one of 5 companies](http://www.nitobi.com/news/?a=61) out of 80 to present at the [Launch Pad](http://www.web2expo.com/webexsf2009/public/content/launchpad) event at Web 2.0 Expo in San Francisco. I get 5 minutes to convince a panel of judges and the crowd (voting in real-time with sms) that [PhoneGap](https://phonegap.com) is the hottest technology product launching at the event. It's described as "American Idol" for business…no pressure;-)

> "For 2009, we continue the tradition of showcasing innovative and promising new companies at Web 2.0 Expo. While the definition of a launch has gotten cloudy in this age of public betas, we're looking for new companies or products that make us take notice. And while venture capital has been the focus in past years, the reality of the market is that companies must gain the attention of customers. So our judging panel and criteria this year focus more on what is essential and transformational in today's market than on ability to get funded. Along the way, we're sure the VCs in the crowd will find several startups they'd like to talk to!"

Good luck to the other presenter and I hope we all manage to provide some value or at least entertainment to the crowd.

The [event](http://www.web2expo.com/webexsf2009/public/schedule/detail/8797) is at 1:15-2:15pm Thursday April 2nd in the Keynote Room (Ballroom - 3rd Level).

I have 2 free passes is anyone is interested. Just leave a comment or email me.

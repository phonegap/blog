<p>I just pushed my work on porting phonegap for Nokia WRT (Web Runtime) on the s60 platform to my github repo, and will get brock to drop it into the main phonegap repo over very soon, but I just wanted to get it out that phonegap for nokia is on its way! Nokia WRT's exposure of device functionality has made it relatively easy to implement phonegap for geolocation, notification, and contact support in nokia wrt widgets. There are some limitations in the WRT environment; one significant one at the moment is that WRT's device API and menu object functionality are exposed only to one main html file. Hopefully can figure out a way around this to stay in line with the phongap ideology. Stay tuned for phonegap Nokia.</p>

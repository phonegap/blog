![Nokia 5800 XpressMusic](http://blogs.nitobi.com/ryan/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Nokia-5800-XpressMusic1.png)

After spending some time on the [Tcktcktck](http://tcktcktck.org) mobile app (built using PhoneGap, pictured), I'm back on PhoneGap. The PhoneGap port formerly known as PhoneGap Nokia should and will be renamed to PhoneGap Symbian (WRT), since Nokia's Web Runtime is part of newer versions of Symbian OS, which is not limited to Nokia devices (Sony Ericsson too, at least). I recently dropped the Tcktcktck mobile app, built with PhoneGap Symbian.WRT, onto a SE Satio, and she worked like a charm, minus a few UI issues stemming from resolution differences.

Now it should be noted that Nokia WRT (with Platform Services, critical) is only on S60 3rd FP2 and S60 5th Edition devices, so currently PhoneGap for Symbian does not span the entire set of Symbian devices. However I'm doing some research on the side as well on building PhoneGap using the [Qt 4.6 beta release](http://qt.nokia.com/developer/qt-4.6-preview), which includes QtWebkit and Symbian OS support.

robbie lou is out for at least a week and i'm crying inside.

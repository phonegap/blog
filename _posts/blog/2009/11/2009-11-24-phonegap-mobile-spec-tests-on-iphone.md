Could not use HTML 5 or _Flash_ for playback. You can download the file as [MPEG4/H.264](http://blogs.nitobi.com/shazron/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/MobileSpecPG.m4v) or [Ogg Theora](http://blogs.nitobi.com/shazron/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/MobileSpecPG.ogg) file.

[Fil](http://blogs.nitobi.com/fil/) who has been working on the [Mobile Spec](http://github.com/filmaj/mobile-spec) came over and we tested the mobile spec on the current (EDGE) version of iPhone PhoneGap, and the tests look pretty sweet (see video).

It was pretty easy, I created a new Phonegap-based Application from the Xcode template, plopped in the contents of the Mobile Spec, and just ran the app in the iPhone Simulator. In this session, we see that iPhone PhoneGap passes 51 out of 64 tests, for a 79% pass rate.

I just received word from Apple that :

1. Apple has given PhoneGap a technical analysis , and PhoneGap does not violate the Terms & Conditions of the App Store.
1. Apple will review PhoneGap applications based on their own merits and not on their use of PhoneGap.

What this means:

There was still some apprehension within the community as to whether or not using PhoneGap would lead to a possible rejection from the iPhone App Store, we definitely have a green light to PhoneGap. This means we can all get back to doing what we love best, building fast, easy mobile apps with JavaScript+HTML+CSS while still taking advantage of the core features in the iPhone, Android, Symbian-WRT and Blackberry devices.

Happy coding!

To follow up with my last post, the WRT javascripts for  phonegap symbian are now up on my [github account](http://github.com/wildabeast/phonegap).

Will get sintaxi to pull soon. But feel free to play with it for now. Nokia's WRT (on Symbian OS) is real easy to use, especially with the PG libraries in there.

Recently added libraries include: camera, sms, orientation, storage, and acceleration.

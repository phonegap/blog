A few weeks ago, Sony Ericsson asked [Digital Dandelion](http://digitaldandelion.net) to build a mobile application from web-based content using their new [WebSDK](http://developer.sonyericsson.com/site/global/newsandevents/latestnews/newsnov09/p_websdk.jsp) and [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com). They built a Google Android app around [the Maverick's Surf contest](http://www.maverickssurf.com/). You can find some screenshots from [the app on Sachin's blog](http://developer.sonyericsson.com/community/people/sachinanand/blog/tags/mavericks).

Jeremiah also put together this great two-minute video talking about using PhoneGap:

You can read the whole story on the Digital Dandelion blog. Here's an excerpt:

> "PhoneGap allows web apps to be first class citizens on mobile platforms. It does this by running web pages inside of a native application, and providing a javascript bridge library to access device features. When you're done, compile and distribute like any other app."

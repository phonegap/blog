<p>So after starting off with Qt 4.6 tower, then upgrading to colossus ), then a beta release candidate, the official Qt 4.6 RAMBO release is here! Well its not called Rambo but it should be. Its got solid Qt Support, though I haven't upgraded my PhoneGap Symbian fork yet, but will shortly. I was hoping we might have the <a href="http://blog.qt.nokia.com/2009/12/01/technology-preview-new-qt-apis-from-mobility-project/">Qt Mobility</a> packages built into the release but I guess there's still some work to be done on them. For now I'll have to continue to include the different libraries via source code, which isn't a big deal.</p>

<p>Brian fowarded me a twitter post of someone who was confused how Qt gets installed on the device … its a sis installer file, just like most other tools and apps (save WRT Widgets). Sis installers can encapsulate other sis installers, so I was thinking Qt could be packaged with PhoneGap apps for deployment. Maybe if developers really start making apps using PhoneGap Symbian with Qt, Symbian will ship with Qt …</p>

<p>There may be some confusion as to how PhoneGap Symbian Qt will be built and deployed, so here's a bit of a step by step of what's required (<a href="http://phonegap.pbworks.com/PhoneGap-Symbian-%28Qt%29">detailed version</a>):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Install the<a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/info/sw.nokia.com/id/ec866fab-4b76-49f6-b5a5-af0631419e9c/S60_All_in_One_SDKs.html"> S60 (Symbian) SDK</a>, <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/products/platform/symbian">Qt 4.6 for Symbian</a> (SDK first, Qt patches it), and their various associated prerequisites.</p></li>


<li><p>Download the <a href="http://github.com/wildabeast/phonegap/tree/symbian.qt">PhoneGap Symbian source code</a>, which which will include the required <a href="http://blog.qt.nokia.com/2009/12/01/technology-preview-new-qt-apis-from-mobility-project/">Qt Mobility APIs</a>.</p></li>


<li><p>Build your webapp using html/js/css and the symbian phonegap.js, and place it in the phonegap/symbian.qt/framework/www/ folder.</p></li>


<li><p>Build and in the emulator, if desired.</p></li>


<li><p>Qt 4.6 includes qt.sis. This installs qt to your symbian phone. Do it.</p></li>


<li><p>Build your application, which will give you your application.sis (self-signed). This will be your distributable. Voila.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Outstanding issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>cannot send xhr's from our local resources (priority)</p></li>


<li><p>many API's still to be implemented</p></li>


<li><p>Symbian Signing</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to post comments if you have any questions.</p>

<p>I just pushed my latest work on PhoneGap Palm to <a href="http://github.com/wildabeast/">my github repo</a>, and it should be pulled over to the main phonegap repo shortly.  </p>

<p>PhoneGap API's available to Palm devices include geolocation, accelerometer, notification, orientation, sms, telephony, network, file (read only), and a limited selection of device properties (see the PhoneGap Mobile Spec running on the Palm Emulator to the left).</p>

<p>Unfortunately the contacts API won't be available for a while, due to the fact that the Mojo API limits data access (including contacts data) to that which was created by the app in context (see <a href="http://developer.palm.com/distribution/viewtopic.php?sid=61f5023a5bf3941c441586a1405f215d&amp;lastaction=login&amp;f=9&amp;t=3323&amp;p=12427&amp;hilit=get+contacts">this discussion</a>). Hopefully this will change.</p>

<p>For those who don't know, Palm's webOs is completely based on web technologies. We've got a couple of Palm Pre's here for testing, and they're sick. And the edit/deploy/test cycle is very smooth. You can test on device and write to a debug console which you can monitor on your SDK console.</p>

<p>Like we did for Symbian WRT, we simply had to write a javascript shim to map the Mojo API (webOs' mobile js API) to the PhoneGap API. I also had to do a bit of messing around with the stage/scene system which they use for changing application views. But its ready for use with the device APIs listed above.</p>

<p>I'll be continuing to work on this and expand the API, and I also hope to get some time to continue my work on PhoneGap Symbian/Qt.</p>

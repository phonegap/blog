Last week we were at Web 2.0 Expo in NYC where we were part of an exciting announcement with Sony Ericsson, the release of the Sony Ericsson WebSDK. The WebSDK is an open source tool created in collaboration with the PhoneGap open source community. With the Sony Ericsson WebSDK, web and mobile developers can create mobile apps using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that access platform features and data including accelerometer, GPS, camera and contacts. Sony Ericsson Web SDK initially supports Android (e.g. XPERIA) and Symbian (Satio) platforms.

“With the Sony Ericsson WebSDK our focus is on bringing all the capabilities of web technologies to mobile applications and giving web developers wide access to easy-to-use tools and mobile phone platforms.” says Christopher David, Head of Developer and Partner Engagement at Sony Ericsson. “We are driving this initiative together with the PhoneGap open source community and invite developers to join us as we offer advanced mobile devices and a clear monetization path.”

> "Mobile development is increasingly no different from Web development, but proprietary hooks remain." said James Governor, RedMonk industry analyst, "By building on Phonegap, Sony Ericcson can grow its developer community and allow the apps built to take advantage of native platform functionality."

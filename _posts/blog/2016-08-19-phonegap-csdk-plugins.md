We've been working on this with the Creative SDK team for a bit and now we are happy to announce the release of the first two PhoneGap Plugins to make use of Adobe's Creative SDK.

- [Client Auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phonegap-plugin-csdk-client-auth): The starting point for all Creative SDK integrations
- [Image Editor UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phonegap-plugin-csdk-image-editor): Powerful photo editing for mobile apps

In order to use these plugins you'll need to [register your application](https://creativesdk.adobe.com/docs/ios/#/articles/gettingstarted/index.html#register_application) to use the Creative SDK and then you'll be able to add the image editing component directly to your PhoneGap app.

Over the next few months we'll be rolling out more Creative SDK functionality like user authentication, send to desktop and the asset browser but feel free to let us know what functionality you want to see in the comments or by raising issues on the plugin's GitHub repo's.

Read more about the release over on the [Creative SDK Blog](https://blog.creativesdk.com/2016/08/phonegap-plugins-for-the-creative-sdk/).

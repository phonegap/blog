Hello everyone, we have updated the PhoneGap Developer App to version 1.6.x. In this version, you will find that we have updated:

- Cordova-iOS@4.1.1
- Cordova-Android@5.0.0
- Cordova-WP8@3.8.1
- Added the phonegap-plugin-push@1.6.0

## Push Plugin Support

I would like to also highlight that we have added push support to the Developer App. There will be a blog post about how to use this new feature coming shortly.

## Install or Update

To get the new version, simply [follow this guide](http://docs.phonegap.com/references/developer-app/update-version/) and you should have the new version in no time.

Who wants to see beautiful Amsterdam this Spring? Not to mention, hang out and learn from some pretty cool people in the PhoneGap/Cordova community? Uh. We do! Come join us in Amsterdam May 19-20 for [PhoneGap Day EU 2016](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2016/).

We're about one month out and we're excited to announce an amazing agenda as well as some cool new things we're doing for the workshop day.

## Agenda

We'll be hosting PhoneGap Day EU at [Het Compagnietheater](http://www.compagnietheater.nl/compagnietheater.html) again. Day one features talks from the PhoneGap team as well as awesome PhoneGap developers who have built super successful apps and have tons of development tips to share.

- [Kerri Shotts](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2016/speaker/kerrishotts/) will be speaking about "Common PhoneGap Gotchas" focusing on various practices you should use to avoid a poor user experience including responding to device events, slow/fast taps, and more!
- [Eddy Verbruggen](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2016/speaker/eddyverbruggen/) will share his first-hand experience developing Cordova apps for medium and large banks.
- Are you a PhoneGap Build user? The entire PhoneGap Build team will be at PhoneGap Day to share what's coming next for Build.

Check out the full agenda [here](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2016/).

## Workshops

Quick note! Workshops will be held in a different venue than the conference. Full details [here](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2016/). Workshops are always crazy popular every year so this year we wanted to make sure you get the most of them. Gone are the days of being locked into one track. This year, we'll have two concurrent workshop tracks so you can choose your workshop adventure depending on your interest and skill level.

- PhoneGap Day pro, [Holly Schinsky](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2016/speaker/hollyschinsky), will be giving a hands-on workshop where you'll learn things like: mobile UI design patterns, app debugging, app configuration, etc. all while building a fully functioning app.
- [Andreas Schacherbauer](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2016/speaker/andreasschacherbauer) from Wikitude will be talking about Augmented Reality apps with PhoneGap!
- Come learn from the best as [Jesse MacFadyen](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2016/speaker/purplecabbage) takes you through this deep dive workshop on making great plugins, from conception to testing to publishing.

## SWAG

And of course we'll have brand new PhoneGap swag courtesy of [Tim Kim](https://twitter.com/timkim). Here's a sneak peek:

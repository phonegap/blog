This release fixes some issues when previewing your app on the latest version of the PhoneGap Developer App (1.7.5+). You should now be able to connect without any issues!

We also added a minor fix for our Windows users that download the app using the zip archive. There is an additional step that must be taken in order for this method to install correctly, instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/blob/master/INSTALL).

## Installation/Update

You can install the latest version of PhoneGap Desktop by following the instructions in our docs:

- [Install on OS X](http://docs.phonegap.com/references/desktop-app/install/mac/)
- [Install on Windows](http://docs.phonegap.com/references/desktop-app/install/win/)

If you already have PhoneGap Desktop installed, you should be receiving an update notification to install this new version upon next use.

Your feedback is what we use to help us shape our roadmap. We appreciate you taking the time to let us know how we can make the app better by [submitting feedback and issues](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop) to an existing issue.

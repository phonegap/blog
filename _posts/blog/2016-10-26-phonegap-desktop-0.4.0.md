We're happy to announce the release of PhoneGap Desktop 0.4.0, with support for PhoneGap templates! These templates help you build apps quickly with popular features like Push Notifications, Augmented Reality and frameworks like React and Framework7. We've also included and recommend our [PhoneGap Star Track](https://phonegap.com/blog/2016/04/21/introducing-star-track-by-phonegap/) template for those who want to get started using a more complete app example.

## Additional Updates

In addition to the template support, we've also added some other updates worth noting:

- **Drag and Drop Workflow**: the drag and drop workflow updates in this release make it even easier to add your existing projects to PhoneGap Desktop. Simply drag a project with a valid `config.xml` into the project list workspace and automatically served for testing.

- **Default Icon Handling**: the default icon handling has changed to now display a CSS placeholder based on the app name when an icon has not already been configured for a project.

- **CLI Integration**: another update that isn't visually noticeable but still important, is the removal of our dependency on the `connect-phonegap` middleware. We are now using the PhoneGap CLI to do all of the project `create` and `serve` functions. This change marks a first step toward maintaining congruency between our Desktop and CLI users going forward.

For more details on the above and all other updates and fixes, see the [0.4.0 CHANGELOG](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/milestone/39?closed=1).

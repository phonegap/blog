<p>PhoneGap has been getting a lot of attention lately, and also a lot of questions on the mailing list about where to get started.  </p>

<p>I recently built a small PhoneGap app for iPhone that helps to demonstrate PhoneGap functions.</p>

<p>The application is divided into multiple pages, and each page focuses on one area of functionality.  </p>

<p>I have strived to keep each page dedicated to the functionality it presents, and present everything as simply as possible.  </p>

<p>There are no dependencies on any other libraries, and the js / css for each page is contained directly there.</p>

<p><strong>The Notifications page demonstrates key navigator.notifications functions.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Custom Alerts - with custom title text, and button text.</p></li>
<li><p>Display a loading screen for a fixed length of time</p></li>
<li><p>Vibrate the device</p></li>
<li><p>Show and hide the Activity Indicator ( the spinner at the top bar )</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Accelerometer page demonstrates navigator.accelerometer functions.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Start + Stop the accelerometer update logic, and play with a bouncing ball.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>( a shout out to Yohei for providing the initial code for this example. )</em></p>

<p><strong>The Contacts page demonstrates navigator.contacts functions.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Display the number of contacts</p></li>
<li><p>Spawn the contact picker screen</p></li>
<li><p>Renders a contact, and makes it clickable, to spawn the contact viewer.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The GeoLocation page demonstrates how to use navigator.geolocation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Gets your current location</p></li>
<li><p>Calls Twitter api using JSONP to get tweets within a mile of your location</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>( a shout out to Girlie Mac http://girliemac.com/blog/ this code was shamelessly borrowed )</em></p>

<p>Hopefully the other platformers will step up and publish / test on other devices.  I have only worked on the iPhone branch so far.</p>

<p>I will be working on the Media api next to demonstrate how easy it is to play mp3s within PhoneGap, and I might even post some of my own music, we'll see.</p>

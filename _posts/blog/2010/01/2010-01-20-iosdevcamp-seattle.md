I had a really great time at [iOSDevCamp Seattle](http://w.atercooler.com/events/2010/07/27/ios-devcamp-seattle) this weekend, put on by [Brian Fling](http://flingmedia.com/) and the guys from [pinch/zoom](http://pinchzoom.com/). I was fortunate enough to speak there about PhoneGap - you can see my slides above and [the video here](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/9073418).

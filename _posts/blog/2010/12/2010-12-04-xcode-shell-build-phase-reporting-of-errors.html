<p><a href="http://blogs.nitobi.com/shazron/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/xcode.png"><img src="http://blogs.nitobi.com/shazron/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/xcode.png" alt="" /></a>Found this useful information, regarding Xcode error reporting for shell build phases. For example, if we were to include <a href="http://www.jslint.com/">JSLint</a> in PhoneGap iPhone, we could format the errors this way below so code where the errors occur are easily editable:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In shell build phases you can write to stderr using the following format:  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><filename>:<linenumber>: error | warn | note : <message>n</strong>  </p>

<p>It's the same format gcc uses to show errors. The filename:linenumber part can be omitted. Depending on the mode (error, warn, note), Xcode will show your message with a red or yellow badge.  </p>

<p>If you include an absolute file path and a line number (if the error occurred in a file), double clicking the error in the build log lets Xcode open the file and jumps to the line, even if it is not part of the project. Very handy.</p>

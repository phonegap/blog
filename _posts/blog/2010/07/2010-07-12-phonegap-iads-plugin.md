Hey its a new plugin for PhoneGap. I call it the "PhoneGap AdPlugin", and even though it only supports iAds currently, there is potential for supporting the other ad networks as a backup to iAds. Make sure you read the RELEASE NOTES in the README for limitations.

Get the [source](http://github.com/shazron/PhoneGap-Plugins/tree/master/AdPlugin/iPhone/) and view the [README](http://github.com/shazron/PhoneGap-Plugins/blob/master/AdPlugin/iPhone/README.md)

Below are screenshots from the test app included, called 'iAdHost'

Here at [Nitobi](http://www.nitobi.com) we're excited to be contributing [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com) to the Symbian Web Runtime. PhoneGap will now be included as part of the [web extensions package](http://developer.symbian.org/main/source/packages/webextensions) in the Symbian^3 platform.

By contributing code that converts PhoneGap APIs to the Symbian WRT API, we've made it easier for Symbian developers to write applications using PhoneGap. You no longer need to include any extra code which, of course, makes deployment faster.

PhoneGap developers benefit by getting even better support for the Symbian WRT platform.

PhoneGap supports WRT 1.1 and implements these APIs: geolocation, accelerometer, camera, vibration, contacts, SMS, sounds, orientation change and storage. The network availability API is under development.

If you're new to PhoneGap, it's worth checking out. PhoneGap is an open source development framework for building cross-platform mobile apps that run on Symbian as well as iPhone/iTouch/iPad, Google Android, Palm and Blackberry. The PhoneGap open source code has been downloaded more than 250K times and there are thousands of PhoneGap apps in app stores and directories.

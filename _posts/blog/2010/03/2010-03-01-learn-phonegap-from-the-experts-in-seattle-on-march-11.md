Learn the easiest way to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build cross-platform mobile apps.

Creators of [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com), a ground-breaking mobile application development framework, will show web developers how to build mobile applications in HTML and JavaScript while still taking advantage of core features of iPhone, Google Android, Blackberry, Symbian and Palm mobile devices. This full-day PhoneGap training session takes place in Seattle on March 11, 2010\. Attendees can register at [http://mobileappdevtraining5.eventbrite.com/](http://mobileappdevtraining5.eventbrite.com/).

PhoneGap gained widespread recognition last year when the project [won the LaunchPad competition at Web 2.0 Expo](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/phone_gap_todays_peoples_choice_winner_at_launch_p.php). Since then, hundreds, even thousands, of PhoneGap applications have been built and submitted to the Apple app store and directories.

In the training session, you'll learn how to use your HTML/JavaScript skills to build app store ready applications for mobile platforms including iPhone, Google Android, Blackberry, Symbian and Palm. At the completion of this course, you'll be able to:

* Set up your development environment
* Compile for multiple platforms
* Run code in a emulator
* Debug your HTML and JavaScript
* Access native APIs, including location, camera, accelerometer, contacts, and more via JavaScript
* Optimize your JavaScript for mobile devices
* Make security considerations
* Build a mobile application that runs offline
* Use CSS transitions, animations and transforms to create native looking interfaces
* Use the Canvas for advanced graphics
* Use mobile JS libraries, such as XUI and Dashcode to build mobile applications faster

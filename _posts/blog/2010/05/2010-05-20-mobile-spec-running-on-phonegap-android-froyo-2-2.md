Lots of new features have been added to Android Froyo 2.2\. Among the most exciting ones are: Better speed with the inclusion of the V8 Javascript engine, JIT compiler as well as a new set of backup/storage and cloud messaging APIs.

I wanted to see how PhoneGap would work on Froyo so I ran mobile-spec on it and below are the results.

As you can see it runs the same as on Android 2.1 and previous ! Some tests fail but there not relevant to the Android Platform (orientation etc…)

<p>Over the past month, I was working from home, and when I wasn't busy wiping spit-up from my kid's face, I was working on various stuff, including a new Android PhoneGap demo to replace the one that I took off the Android market.  The problem with these demos is that they do not stand the test of time.  However, this one should.  After playing with C5Bench a couple months ago, I decided to do a quick hack of the Canvas.  After many bug fixes to PhoneGap Android later, I finally managed to put together this simple example:</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.nitobi.com/joe/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/phone_gap_screen.png"><img src="http://blogs.nitobi.com/joe/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/phone_gap_screen.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Now, of course, this is an early version, and the code has been thrown together very quickly, and there are bugs, which is why I haven't posted it in the market, but you can download and try out the application <a href="http://blogs.nitobi.com/joe/AccelDemo.apk">here</a>, or scan in the QR code below.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.nitobi.com/joe/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/accel_demo_qr.png"><img src="http://blogs.nitobi.com/joe/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/accel_demo_qr.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>This code is based on a few examples that I found on the web of good Canvas Tutorials, namely the <a href="http://billmill.org/static/canvastutorial/">Breakout Clone tutorial</a> by Bill Mill.  It's a pretty solid tutorial and shows how to effects like bounce fairly effectively.  Of course, I didn't add bounce, because I wanted more of a sliding bubble effect.  I also decided to NOT use the jQuery framework to keep the javascript code as small as possible.  (In fact, I didn't even use XUI, since I didn't see the need).</p>

<p>That being said, I'm definitely going to have to work on my own JS library at some point that maintains complex objects, since redrawing functions can quickly become large and cumbersome, even when using a JS library, which is better suited to the DOM and not pixel-manipulation.</p>

<p>So, basically you move around two objects which are directly related to each other on a screen with the accelerometer, and the method that we use is below:</p>

<p>`  </p>

<p>var watchAccel = function()  </p>

<p>{  </p>

<p>var canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");  </p>

<p>canvas.width = document.body.clientWidth;  </p>

<p>canvas.height = document.body.clientHeight - 100;  </p>

<p>ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");  </p>

<p>var succ = function(a){  </p>

<pre><code>updateValues(a);  

updateDraw(a);
</code></pre>

<p>};  </p>

<p>var fail = function(){};  </p>

<p>var opt = {};  </p>

<p>opt.frequency = 100;  </p>

<p>timer = navigator.accelerometer.watchAcceleration(succ, fail, opt);  </p>

<p>}  </p>

<p>`</p>

<p>Now, what's interesting is how the frequency is handled.  Currently, we use the setInterval to do this, exactly like the iPhone.  However, this actually kinda sucks, and we may in the future move more of this into the Java land, similar to how we manage the Geolocation code that we use.  However, this is good enough to create the sliding bubble effect of the application.  I hope to have the final version of the app up and working before Google IO, however I'll probably post it up to GitHub this week, feel free to try and and let me know if there's serious issues.</p>

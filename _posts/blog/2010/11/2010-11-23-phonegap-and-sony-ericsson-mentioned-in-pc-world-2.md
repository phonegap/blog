![](http://blogs.sonyericsson.com/developerworld/files/2010/11/websdk4_blog4.jpg)Sony Ericsson released their [WebSDK Packager](http://blogs.sonyericsson.com/developerworld/2010/11/23/now-hack-this-websdk-packager-source-code-on-github/) this week as an open source project on Github. We're really excited about this obviously because it's built on top of PhoneGap. Our new Build service also got a little plug in the PC World coverage:

> "Earlier this month, Nitobi announced the beta of PhoneGap Build, a cloud-based tool that allows developers to write applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, upload their apps to PhoneGap Build, and get back applications that work natively on smartphones based on Android, webOS, Symbian and the BlackBerry OS, and soon on iOS, Windows Mobile, MeeGo and Bada."

Nice to see the mainstream tech media picking up on the issues and tooling around cross platform mobile apps.

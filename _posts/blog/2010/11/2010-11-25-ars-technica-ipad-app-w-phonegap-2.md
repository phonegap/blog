A couple weeks ago Ars Technica released their iPad App. It's certainly one of the nicer PhoneGap apps I've seen today. It's very simple and feels like a native in look and in feel. Scrolling through the articles is great. IBM built the app for them, which is very exciting to us at Nitobi and for the rest of the PhoneGap project. It's a great example of what can be achieved with HTML5, JS and CSS. They have a full write up on how they built it on their [blog](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/11/introducing-the-ars-technica-reader-for-ipad.ars).

Here's a quick video of me interacting with the app:

Download it from iTunes [here](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ars-technica/id393859050?mt=8). Let me know what you think and if you have any feedback. There's also an [update on the Ars blog](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/11/ars-application-redux-where-were-going.ars) about how they're planning to improve scrolling and navigation in a future release of the app. Kudos to them on a job well done and being very transparent about that!

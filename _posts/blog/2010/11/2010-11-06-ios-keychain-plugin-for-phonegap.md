So what is the Keychain? It's a framework to store data (particularly passwords) securely on Mac OS X and iOS. You really don't want to store passwords and other sensitive information in HTML5 local or web storage. This is a PhoneGap plugin for iOS that provides access to the Keychain through Javascript. Based on  Buzz Andersen's work - namely [SFHFKeychainUtils](https://github.com/ldandersen/scifihifi-iphone/tree/master/security/)

View the [README](http://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/blob/master/iPhone/Keychain/README.md) and check out the sample app's [index.html](http://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/blob/master/iPhone/Keychain/KeychainPlugin-Host/www/index.html) for usage. Play around with the Get, Set, and Remove examples, should be self-explanatory.

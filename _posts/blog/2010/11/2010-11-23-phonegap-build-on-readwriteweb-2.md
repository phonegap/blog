Just wanted to point out a great post on [PhoneGap Build](http://build.phonegap.com) on the ReadWriteWeb:

> PhoneGap's newly launched service, PhoneGap Build, the compilation of native apps using standard Web technologies is done in the cloud. Also, unlike many competitors, PhoneGap Build is free - at least for now, while in beta. And it will remain free for any open source projects in the future.
>
> PhoneGap Build eliminates the complexities involved with building mobile applications for the increasingly diverse mobile OS landscape, where each operating system requires the use of its own SDK (software development kit) and programming languages.

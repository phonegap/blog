One of the really exciting things we're seeing here at PhoneGap is that more tools, IDEs and Plugins are including PhoneGap support. Not only does this make PhoneGap development easier, it demonstrates that the PhoneGap framework is being embraced by the larger dev community. Here are a few examples:

[](http://unify.github.com/unify/)[![Unify Project](http://www.phonegap.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/unify.png)](http://www.phonegap.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/unify.png)Unify is a [Deutsche Telekom](http://www.telekom.de/) project launched in September of this year. It's a metaframework for mobile built on HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. Unify combines PhoneGap, [qooxdoo](http://qooxdoo.org/), [Sass](http://www.sass-lang.com/) and [Adobe AIR](http://adobe.com/products/air) to provide a unified API for building cross-platform mobile and desktop apps. The goal is faster app development.

![](http://www.phonegap.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/jquery.png)We're stoked to see the launch of [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) 1.0 today. jQuery Mobile is a user interface framework, built on top of jQuery, designed to simplify the process of building applications that target mobile devices. The project already has a number of components, layouts, and theming tools that make building a mobile app easier. jQuery Mobile [strongly recommends](http://jquerymobile.com/2010/10/jquery-mobile-alpha-1-released/) PhoneGap for deploying HTML/CSS/JavaScript applications to a mobile device.

Another helpful tool is [Ripple Emulator](http://nitobiinc.cmail1.com/t/y/l/ciiujk/l/t), a multi-platform mobile environment emulator for mobile widget testing. Try it to test your PhoneGap apps

We're keeping track of these tools as they emerge, but we need your help. Please contribute to this list on the PhoneGap wiki.

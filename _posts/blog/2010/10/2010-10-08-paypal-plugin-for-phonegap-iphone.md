First release of the PayPal Plugin for PhoneGap iPhone. Right now it handles static payments only (no dynamic changes to include shipping etc). Thanks to Chris Booth of [Signature Digital](http://signaturedigital.co.uk/) in the UK for sponsoring development and also allowing it to be released to the PhoneGap community.

Nothing much to look at in the first screenshot, but with CSS styling and using PayPal's official web button images it can look better. View the [README](http://github.com/shazron/phonegap-plugins/blob/master/iPhone/PayPalPlugin/README.md) and check out the sample app's [index.html](http://github.com/shazron/phonegap-plugins/blob/master/iPhone/PayPalPlugin/PayPalPlugin-Host/www/index.html) for usage. Triggering the "Pay" button will launch the native workflow in the second screenshot.

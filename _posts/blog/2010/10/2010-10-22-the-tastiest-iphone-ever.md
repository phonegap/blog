To celebrate Nitobi's moving into new offices, we had an iPhone cake made by the good folks at [The Uncommon Cake](http://www.theuncommoncake.com/). They even added some PhoneGap apps to the phone, including [A Binary Clock](http://itunes.apple.com/app/a-binary-clock/id294486524?mt=8), [NYC Tip](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ny-tip/id356123310?mt=8), [Ponderisms](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ponderisms/id379246228?mt=8), [Sales Targets](http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/sales-targets/id366755359?mt=8), [Entrepreneur](http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/entrepreneur/id320977738?mt=8) and [Questomatic](http://itunes.apple.com/app/questomatic/id301049636?mt=8).

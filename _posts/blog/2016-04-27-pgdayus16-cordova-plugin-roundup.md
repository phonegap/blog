A big thanks to everyone who was able to make it to PhoneGap Day US 2016 in Lehi, UT. We'll be posting more videos from the conference (and the workshops!) so check back on our [blog](https://phonegap.com/blog/tag/phonegap-day/) and [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PhoneGap).

Big thanks to [Telerik](http://www.telerik.com/) for sponsoring PhoneGap Day US 2016! We got to hear from [TJ VanToll](https://twitter.com/tjvantoll), Senior Developer Advocate, as he goes through the latest and greatest in the Cordova plugin world.

In the last few years Cordova plugins have become the cornerstone of many high-quality Cordova and PhoneGap applications. In just the last year, the Telerik team have grown their curated Cordova plugins marketplace from small handful of plugins to now 65 and counting. In this talk TJ will go over the latest greatest in the Cordova plugin world, including plugins for the Apple Watch, Mapbox maps, and a whole lot more.

Watch the presentation recording below.

Whoa, can you believe it's been two weeks since PhoneGap Day EU 2016 in Amsterdam? It was an honor to host members of the PhoneGap community from all over the world at the beautiful [Het Compagnietheater](http://www.compagnietheater.nl/compagnietheater.html). We couldn't have done it without our partners Web Conferences Amsterdam (the team behind [Mobilism](http://mobilism.nl/2015)).

## Day 1

We had another amazing lineup of speakers for this PhoneGap Day. Our diverse group of speakers came in from all over the world to inform and entertain our attendees. [Kerri Shotts](https://twitter.com/photoKandy) got things started off right with an epic talk on _Common PhoneGap Gotchas_. This talk is a must watch for beginner and advanced PhoneGap Developers.

[Remy Sharp](https://twitter.com/rem) gave us a thought provoking talk called _State of the Gap_ in which he posits do we still need PhoneGap? The TL;DR answer is yes but we are still committed to the original goal of PhoneGap which is to cease to exist someday when browsers catch up. Remy followed up his talk with a great [blog post](https://remysharp.com/2016/05/28/state-of-the-gap) with the same title.

We were a little worried that his plane wouldn't make it in time but we were so happy to be able to have [Sani Yusuf](https://twitter.com/saniyusuf) fly in from Nigeria. Sani killed it with his talk on how _Hybrid Apps Powering African Mobile Solutions_. You think you know a lot about mobile development but there are unique challenges when you target your app to other countries and Sani's talk is so eye opening and informative.

You know, we wished we could have brought over all of our incredible speakers from PhoneGap Day US 2016 but we knew that we had to have [Dean Haddock](https://twitter.com/systemconscious) of [StoryCorps](https://storycorps.org/) talk about how users are using the StoryCorps app to share their stories and connect with one another. I dare you to watch the video when it becomes available and not have all of the feels.

We had so many incredible talks so be sure to check out the decks - we'll be adding more soon! We'll also be posting the recordings on the blog over the coming weeks so keep an eye out:

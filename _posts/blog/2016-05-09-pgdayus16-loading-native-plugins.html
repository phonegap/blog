<p>A big thanks to everyone who was able to make it to PhoneGap Day US 2016 in Lehi, UT. We'll be posting more videos from the conference (and the workshops!) so check back on our <a href="http://phonegap.com/blog/tag/phonegap-day/">blog</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PhoneGap">Youtube channel</a>.</p>

<p>Our next PhoneGap Day US 2016 video comes from our own <a href="https://twitter.com/shazron">Shazron Abdullah</a>. Hot-code reload for html/css/js is so 2015, everyone can do it. You probably thought you couldn't hot-reload plugin native code, well you were wrong! Shaz shows us how in the video below:</p>

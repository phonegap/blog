Remarkably I accomplished nearly everything on my list of goals for 2008 in some form. Rather than subjecting you to a boring recap of my personal minutia here's what I hope to achieve this year.

## Technology to learn

* **Learn Erlang.** I've started a little early and its just fun. Mind. Bending. Such a different way of designing software.
* **Possibly learn Objective-C.** Begrudgingly. Objective-C has to be one of the _least_ portable languages out there but in the interest of [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com) I feel I should understand this technology better.
* **Use CouchDB.** Interestingly, at this time last year, I was looking at ThruDB. Document centric databases: oh yes.

## Conferences to attend

* One of: [Mountain West RubyConf](http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/), [RubyConf](http://rubyconf.org/) or [RubyFringe](http://rubyfringe.com/)
* [IxDA 09](http://interaction09.ixda.org/)
* [JavaOne](http://java.sun.com/javaone/). We're hoping to talk about Merb/Rails on JRuby and, of course, [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com) hacking.
* [GeoWeb 2009](http://geowebconference.org/). Hoping to have the opportunity to talk about PhoneGap and geo location.

## Places to visit

* Europe. I've never been. I'm 30\. Time to go.
* Burningman. I've been too many times to be healthy but chances are I will return to that desert again.

## Odds and ends

* Learn to sail.
* Learn to shoot the center of a dime out from 30 feet with my buddy [Al](http://allanharding.com).
* Continue my study of philosophy.

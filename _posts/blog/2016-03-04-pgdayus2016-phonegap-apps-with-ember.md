A big thanks to everyone who was able to make it to PhoneGap Day US 2016 in Lehi, UT. We'll be posting more videos from the conference (and the workshops!) so check back on our [blog](https://phonegap.com/blog/tag/phonegap-day/) and [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PhoneGap).

Our next talk comes from [Alex Blom](https://twitter.com/AlexBlom) who talks about building awesome PhoneGap applications with Ember.

The benefits of hybrid applications are obvious (less code, simpler code, iterate faster). Developers often make quick pace, boot their app and then hit a wall trying to make it 'feel native'. This talk will discuss lessons learned & optimization techniques from having built many apps with Ember & phonegap. While this talk uses Ember & Ember packages, the tools and techniques discussed generically apply to any PhoneGap application.

Slides available [here](http://www.slideshare.net/AlexBlom/phonegap-day-2016-emberjs-hybrid-apps-tips).

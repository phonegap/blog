<p>It's only been a few weeks since we celebrated PhoneGap Day in Amsterdam and we're already feeling a little nostalgic. You are too? Oh good. Well, let's wax nostalgic together and relive the workshop day with videos! Conference videos coming soon.</p>

<p>PhoneGap Day EU 2016 workshops sold out in record time this year so we opened up 2 concurrent tracks of great content all day. We repeated a few workshops from the US event as well as adding some new ones. These are a must watch! In case you missed the workshop videos from PhoneGap Day US 2016, check out the playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqoBTl91Z2GHdHR-gLfEjvglADszHuc0N">here</a>. Full disclosure, this is the first time we've recorded the workshops from PhoneGap Day EU and we're still working out some kinks. Audio on some of the videos is super quiet and audio completely cuts out for the last 10 minutes of Simon MacDonald's Push Notification workshop (<i>all the sad faces</i>) :(. We've included the slide links in the video descriptions so you can follow along even without the audio.</p>

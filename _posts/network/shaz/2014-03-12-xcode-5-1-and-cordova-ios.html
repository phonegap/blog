These issues have been fixed if you are running the latest dev code (slated for 3.5.0). There are 3 issues related to Cordova iOS 3.4.0 running with Xcode 5.1 (and its command-line tools): 1. CB-6150 &#8211; objc_msgSend causes EXC_BAD_ACCESS with plugins on arm64 2. CB-6223 &#8211; Build/linker errors 3. ios-sim does not work anymore For [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=shazronatadobe.wordpress.com&#038;blog=24879806&#038;post=715&#038;subd=shazronatadobe&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

I've just posted two zip files to my <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> account.   <br /><br /><br />1)&nbsp;<a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/887989/barcode/BarcodeLibraryProject.zip">Barcode scanner library project</a><br />2)&nbsp;<a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/887989/barcode/BarcodeScanner.zip">Barcode scanner example project</a><br /><div><br /><div>Import both of these projects into Eclipse and you should be all set to go. Hopefully seeing the full projects will help people get up and running.</div><div><br /></div><div>If this works for you and you don't already have Dropbox sign up for the free service <a href="http://db.tt/vhWSDrC">via my&nbsp;referral&nbsp;link</a> so I can have more space to host future example projects. Thanks!<br /><br /><b>Update:</b>&nbsp;The easiest way to get this projects into Eclipse is to do the following. In Eclipse, go to&nbsp;the File menu, select the Import option, expand the Android folder, select Existing Android Code into Workspace. Then in the dialog that pops up select Finish. Now the project has been imported. If you have an error in your project, specifically with AndroidManifest.xml then you will want to right click on the project folder and select properties. Select Android and then choose the latest version of the Android SDK that you have installed. At this point the errors should go away, if they don't select the Project menu then Clean.</div></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/72386855013225666-8981315489936177048?l=simonmacdonald.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>

The GalleryPlugin is used when you need to add or remove a file from&nbsp;the Gallery or Music apps. Typical use cases include downloading an image from the internet and wanting it to show up in&nbsp;the Android Gallery app or conversely you delete a file and you don't want the dreaded black rectangle to be left in&nbsp;the Gallery app.<br /><br /><br />First lets take a look at what the gallery.js file. It's written using the cordova.define template but it still adds itself into window.plugins for those of you using the old style plugins:<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4687773.js?file=gallery.js"></script><br />Then will move on to the Java code. I've trimmed down code only to show the execute method for brevity.<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4687773.js?file=GalleryPlugin.java"></script><br />In order to use this plugin you'll need to include the gallery.js in your HTML as a script tag:<br/><script src="https://gist.github.com/4687773.js?file=scriptinc.js"></script><br />and add a line to res/xml/config.xml to tell the JavaScript side where to find your Java class:<br/><script src="https://gist.github.com/4687773.js?file=gallery.xml"></script><br />Now you should be able to add and remove images from the gallery. Here is some sample code to get you going:  <script src="https://gist.github.com/4687773.js?file=galleryexample.js"></script><br />

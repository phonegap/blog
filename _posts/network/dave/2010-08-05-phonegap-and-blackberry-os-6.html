	<p>RIM OS 6 for BlackBerry smartphones is being released very soon on the new BlackBerry Torch 9800.</p>
<p>It looks like a pretty nice upgrade from OS 5, most notably including a WebKit based browser. This should be a *huge* improvement for PhoneGap on BlackBerry.</p>
<p>The bad news is that OS 6 will not work on a lot of the older hardware. OS 6 will run on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storm 3 (as yet unreleased)</li>
<li>Bold 9700</li>
<li>Bold 9650</li>
<li>Perl 9100</li>
</ul>
<p>Notable devices missing from that list are the original Bold 9000 and the Storm 1 and 2. Those will be stuck on OS 5.</p>
<p>The kicker here is that anecdotally, and based on&nbsp;<a href="http://metrics.admob.com/">AdMob stats from April 2010</a>, the most widely used RIM devices (remember AdMob stats represent devices that ads are being served to) are from the BlackBerry Curve line 8300 and 8520 in the US and UK respectively.</p>
<p>The tentative plan for PhoneGap on BlackBerry is likely going to be a &ldquo;final&rdquo; release for BlackBerry 4.6 / 4.7 tagged on Github (sometime in the near future) and then shifting focus to BlackBerry Widgets on OS 5 and 6.</p>

If you build hybrid apps using PhoneGap/Cordova for iOS, you are likely aware that Apple recently announced a new WKWebView for iOS 8 which has major performance optimizations over the UIWebView including access to the Nitro JIT JavaScript engine. Benchmark tests with Nitrous enabled report a 40%-80% performance spike. (See this link for more details). [&#8230;]

The dates for PhoneGap Day EU and US were just announced and there's a call out for speakers. If you have something cool or interesting you're working on (or late night side project :)) related to mobile web, definitely submit it! The sessions are typically around 20 mins in length, and the topics can vary [&#8230;]

I created a new sample push notification app recently to highlight some new changes in iOS 8 and show an example of implementing them with a currently popular stack of frameworks available to build hybrid mobile apps quickly. The sample app is built using Ionic with ngCordova to take advantage of the Cordova PushPlugin wrapper [&#8230;]

I've seen a lot of people (including myself!) have some issues with PhoneGap 3. It is definitely a big change from previous versions. I thought it might be good to have an open meeting over Connect (this is our online meeting solution, all you need is a browser) later this week to talk about it. This won't be a formal presentation per se (although I've got a few slides in mind just to help outline the discussion), but rather a chance for me to explain how things have changed from earlier versions and talk about some things you can to make the process easier. It is also a chance for you to ask questions and share your thoughts about PhoneGap 3.0.

I won't pretend that I'll have all the answers, but I'll do my best to gather questions and - at worst - bring them to the smarter folks and try to get answers posted here as soon as possible.

The meeting will be this Friday, September 6th, at 1:30 PM CST. You can attend by simply going to this URL: <a href="http://experts.adobeconnect.com/pg3ftw/">http://experts.adobeconnect.com/pg3ftw/</a>. If you think you will attend, please RSVP by posting a comment below. (You don't have to, I'm just judging the expected size.)<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RaymondCamdensColdfusionBlog/~4/AIhaijhR93w" height="1" width="1"/>

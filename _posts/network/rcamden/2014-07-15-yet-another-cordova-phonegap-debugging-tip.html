<p>
Want another way to debug Cordova/PhoneGap apps? This isn't new, but I tend to forget about this option and it came in handy yesterday so I thought I would share. When you send builds to the simulator/device via the command line, you may notice that at the end of all the output about building this and generating that, you get these two lines:
</p><p>
<code>2014-07-14 17:23:36.846 ios-sim[1335:507] stderrPath: /Users/ray/readtextfile/platforms/ios/cordova/console.log<br/>
2014-07-14 17:23:36.847 ios-sim[1335:507] stdoutPath: /Users/ray/readtextfile/platforms/ios/cordova/console.log</code>
</p>

<p>
What this is telling you is that you have a log file that will report on errors from your application. This also includes console.log output. (As well as console.dir.) If you simply <code>tail -f</code> this file in another terminal tab (and yes, you get tail -f in Windows too with the right download), you get your console output as plain text right in your terminal. Here is an example from what I was working on yesterday.

So a few weeks ago, my publisher ran an awesome deal for my Cordova book and their upcoming Ionic book. Today they are running the same deal. You can pick up &#8220;Apache Cordova in Action&#8221; and &#8220;Ionic in Action&#8221; both for half off. These are both MEAP versions, which basically mean an &#8220;in progress&#8221; copy [&#8230;]

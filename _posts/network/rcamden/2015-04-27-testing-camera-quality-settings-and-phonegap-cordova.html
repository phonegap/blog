As you know, when using the Camera plugin with PhoneGap/Cordova, you have an optional quality setting. It accepts values from 0 to 100 with 50 being the default. I was curious as to how much of an impact this setting had on the final result. Obviously quality can be subjective, but I thought it would [&#8230;]

<p>
This Friday at 1PM CST, I'll be hosting an online Google Hangout about debugging mobile web/Cordova applications. This is a repeat of what I did at this years FluentConf, so if you couldn't make it, this is your chance. Note that I've set the meeting length to 1.5 hours. It will be much shorter than that. The original presentation was 30 minutes and I anticipate it taking about the same. I'm not sure what Google Hangouts will do if I go past the end of a meeting so I wanted to ensure we didn't get cut off. For folks who can't make it, it will be posted to YouTube about an hour later.

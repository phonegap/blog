A few weeks ago Apache Cordova 3.3.0 was released (you can read the details <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/announcements/2013/12/16/cordova-330.html">here</a>) and one of the things that caught my eye was this:
</p><blockquote>
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-5487">CB-5487</a> Enable Remote Debugging when your Android app is debuggable.
</blockquote>

<p>
Chrome Remote Debugging is a cool feature, but so far it had not been available with PhoneGap apps. I can confirm that with a Cordova 3.3.0 project, this works great. I made a virgin project, launched it (in the emulator), and it showed up right away as a debuggable device. (Note that your emulator has to be using Android 4.4 or higher.)

And just to prove it works, I went into the DOM, modified it, and it showed up live in the app itself.

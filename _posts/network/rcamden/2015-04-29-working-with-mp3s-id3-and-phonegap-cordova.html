As someone who remembers when MP3s became a de facto standard for audio files (*), I'm pretty familiar with the format used to embed metadata within them &#8211; ID3. If you've ever wondered how your favorite MP3 player displayed data about your music (artist, album, year, etc.), most likely it came from the ID3 tags [&#8230;]

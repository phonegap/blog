Yesterday I struggled to get &#8211; what I thought &#8211; was a simple thing working in Cordova &#8211; adding a splash screen to Android. According to the docs, at minimum, you should be able to do this: &#60;splash src="res/splash.png" /&#62; This worked fine for me in iOS but in Android, just gave me a blank [&#8230;]

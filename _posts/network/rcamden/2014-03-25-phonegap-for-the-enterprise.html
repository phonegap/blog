This is just a quick FYI type post, but today Adobe announced "PhoneGap for the Enterprise". You can read more about it at the PhoneGap Blog: <a href="https://phonegap.com/blog/2014/03/24/introducing-phonegap-for-the-enterprise/">Introducing PhoneGap for the Enterprise</a>.
</p><p>
From that blog, some of the details are:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Better collaboration</strong> - With our new PhoneGap Enterprise app, developer team members and business colleagues can view the latest version of apps in production, development and staging</li>
<li><strong>App editing capabilities</strong> – Non-developer colleagues can edit and improve the app experience using a simple drag-and-drop interface from the new Adobe Experience Manager apps; this way developers can focus on building new features, not on making updates.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics & optimization</strong> – Teams can immediately start measuring app performance with Adobe Analytics; we're also planning to incorporate functionality so teams can start A/B testing their way to higher app engagement and monetization using Adobe Target.</li>
<li><strong>Push notifications</strong> – Engage your customers on-the-go with push notifications from Adobe Campaign</li>
<li><strong>Support and training</strong> - PhoneGap Enterprise comes with SLA and support so customers can be rest assured that Adobe PhoneGap has their back.
</ul>

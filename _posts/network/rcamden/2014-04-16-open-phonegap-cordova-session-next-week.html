It has been a while, but next week (Wednesday, April 23rd) at 12PM CST, <a href="http://devgirl.org/">Holly Schinsky</a> and myself will be hosting an open Q and A session for PhoneGap and Cordova. We've run these before and they are pretty successful. There will not be any presentation, but we will take your questions and try to answer them as well as we can. These sessions tend to bring up great discussions and are a good chance to see what other people are struggling with as well. We won't make a recording, but we will share the text of the questions and answers after the session is complete.

We will use Connect for this and the URL will be: <a href="https://my.adobeconnect.com/r5ld5x2k7na/">https://my.adobeconnect.com/r5ld5x2k7na/</a>.

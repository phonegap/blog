I say &#8220;possible&#8221; because I haven't read it myself, but a reader pointed me to this book by Eric Bidelman, &#8220;Using the HTML5 Filesystem API&#8221;. It is nearly four years old, but the reader said it helped him, and I know folks are desperate for more help with the FileSystem so I thought I'd pass [&#8230;]

So, all these socialist open-source evangelists make you want to punch a kitten and fire someone. You want your source code
private. But you still want to pull your app from Github to PhoneGap Build (and build using open-source
project PhoneGap). Well, now you can.

Just link your PhoneGap Build account to your Github account, and you'll be able to enter in a private
Github repo url when creating a new app. 
<!-- end-slug -->

In addition, we've simplified this process by having all your Github repo urls (private and public) 
pre-populated in a combo box. When you create a new app, just start typing your Github repo name, or click
the arrow, and select the repo you want to pull from. Screw open-source!

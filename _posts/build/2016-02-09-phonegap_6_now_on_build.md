### Some notes about Cordova Windows

As mentioned above, this update includes a move from the deprecated cordova-wp8 platform to the cordova-windows platform. If you have a look at the source repository's readme file, you'll probably notice that this platform includes the ability to target Windows 8.1 & 10 (Desktop) in addition to Windows Phone 8.1. At this time PhoneGap Build only supports the Windows Phone 8.1 builds -- but we hope to support Windows Desktop in the near future as well. *Be aware that we are releasing Cordova Windows support under a beta tag -- let us know if you find issues!* Additionally Hydration is not yet supported on Cordova Windows 4.x (in progress).

On all platforms, if you are a plugin owner, you'll need to ensure your plugins work with the above versions so you can continue to use them. Follow the links above for more information.

### How do I build for Windows Phone 7?

Building for Windows Phone 7 is as simple as building for any other Build project.

Simply upload your HTML5 source code and assets, sit back and wait for our Build Bots to compile your deployable package. Within moments, you will have a package ready for testing on an emulator or device.

We support PhoneGap 1.5.0 for Windows Phone 7 right now; support for subsequent releases will be available at the same time as other platforms. To build older apps for Windows Phone 7, please update the PhoneGap Version to 1.5.0.

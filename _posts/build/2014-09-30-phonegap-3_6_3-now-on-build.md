We've made Phonegap / Cordova 3.6.3 available on Phonegap Build - upgrade now! For more details on what's changed, check out the [Apache Cordova 3.6 release blog post](http://cordova.apache.org/announcements/2014/09/22/cordova-361.html). In addition, we've recently updated to the latest versions of all core plugins on Phonegap Build -- [more details here](http://community.phonegap.com/nitobi/topics/core-plugins-have-been-updated-on-phonegap-build).

If you're working with iOS, some more recommended reading is [Shazron Abdullah's recent blog post on iOS 8 and Cordova](http://shazronatadobe.wordpress.com/2014/09/18/cordova-ios-and-ios-8/). In fact, if you're working with Cordova / Phonegap iOS, you should be reading all of Shazron's blog posts. Do it.

If you have any trouble updating, [just ask](http://community.phonegap.com).

Hey folks, we are happy to announce you can now use git-backed **public** plugins on PhoneGap Build.

This enables you to iterate and test plugins for your apps without the need to upload them to PhoneGap Build or the npm repository.

Adding git-backed plugins to your application is easy and is compatible with the Cordova-CLI config.xml format. All you have to do is add your repository to the `spec` attribute of the `<plugin />` element in your config.xml. It's pretty straight forward so we'll just give some examples:

    // install plugin from a git repository (name is optional)
    <plugin spec="https://github.com/example/cordova-plugin.git" source="git" />

    // it doesn't have to be GitHub, it can be any git server
    <plugin spec="https://bitbucket.org/example/cordova-plugin.git" source="git" />

    // if it's a full URI the source attribute is optional, as it'll be assumed
    // it's git-backed. This also means it's compatible with the Cordova CLI
    <plugin spec="https://github.com/example/cordova-plugin.git" />

    // if you want to reference a tag, branch or single commit or
    // any commit-ish, add it at the end. Recommended, otherwise it'll
    // just grab the head of master!!!
    <plugin spec="https://bitbucket.org/example/cordova-plugin.git#v1.0.1" />
    <plugin spec="https://github.com/example/cordova-plugin.git#exp-branch" />
    <plugin spec="https://bitbucket.org/example/cordova-plugin.git#61523d1" />

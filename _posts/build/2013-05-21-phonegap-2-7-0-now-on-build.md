Great news, we've pushed 2.7.0 support to PhoneGap Build! With this release we're deprecating anything less than PhoneGap 2.0.0. Check out [the blog post where 'we told you so'](https://phonegap.com/blog/build/ending-support-for-phonegap-1-9/) for more info on why.

For details on what's changed in PhoneGap 2.7.0:

* [phonegap.com 2.7.0 release blog post](https://phonegap.com/blog/2013/04/30/pg-270-released/)
* [details on the iOS updates in 2.7.0 by Shazron Abdullah](http://shazronatadobe.wordpress.com/2013/05/03/whats-new-in-cordova-ios-2-7-0/)
* [details on the Android updates in 2.7.0 by Joe Bowser](http://infil00p.org/android/cordova/2013/05/03/whats-new-for-cordova-2-7-0/)

We highly recommend upgrading so you can take advantage of all of the bug fixes and performance enhancements that the Cordova team has been hard at work on -- but also so the PhoneGap Build team can focus on support for the latest and greatest.

If you have trouble with your upgrade (or anything else PhoneGap Build related), [hit us up for some support](http://community.phonegap.com/nitobi). Upgrade. Do it!

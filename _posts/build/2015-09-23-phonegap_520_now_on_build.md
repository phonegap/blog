PhoneGap 5.2.0 is now available on PhoneGap Build! To use it, add the following to your config.xml:

    <preference name="phonegap-version" value="cli-5.2.0" />

This version uses the following individual platform releases:
 - *iOS: 3.9.1*
 - *Android: 4.1.1*
 - *Winphone8: 3.8.1 

Also make sure your third party plugins all are up-to-date, and that your core plugins are being sourced from <b>NPM</b>, like so:

    <gap:plugin name="cordova-plugin-camera" source="npm" />

If you're updating from pre-5.1.1, <a href="https://phonegap.com/blog/2015/06/16/phonegap-updated-on-build/">read this blog post</a>.

**Note**: iOS 9 is not officially supported yet, and there are some known issues. The Cordova open-source project team is hard at work on Cordova iOS 4.0, which will include iOS 9 support.

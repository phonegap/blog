Hey Build users! We've been working hard on Build over the last couple
weeks. The progress we've made should help us provide a better user
experience and quality of service.

<!-- end-slug -->

## Progress for March 4 - March 18:

  * Security overhaul to patch various aspects of our system.
  * Upgraded Xcode on all of our OSX systems.
  * Various bug patches
      * [Issue #78](https://github.com/phonegap/build/issues/78)
        Unable to unlink Github accounts.
      * [Issue #79](https://github.com/phonegap/build/issues/79)
        IOS unlock is now consistent with our documentation.
      * [Issue #92](https://github.com/phonegap/build/issues/92)
        Cannot change Github source URL.
      * [Issue #84](https://github.com/phonegap/build/issues/84)
        Collaborator role not saved.
      * [Issue #83](https://github.com/phonegap/build/issues/83)
        Missing translation string.
      * [Issue #80](https://github.com/phonegap/build/issues/80)
        Unable to choose default key.
  * Adding pagination for users with a large volume of applications
    (25+ apps)
  * Internal tooling to help manage our servers.
  * Merging changes contributed by the Build team from
    [pluginstall](https://github.com/alunny/pluginstall)
    to [plugman](https://github.com/imhotep/plugman). This will allow
    for us to align ourselves with the Cordova plugin architecture.
  * Working with the Cordova team on a plugin distribution channel
    architecture that will be supported by Build.
  * Working on integrating [Medic](https://github.com/filmaj/medic)
    to provide a continuous integration system to validate
    PhoneGap distributions and plugin distributions.
  * Actively integrating the PushWoosh plugin into Build.

## Plans for March 18 - March 25:

  * Continue working on integrating Plugman
  * Continue working on integration Medic into our workflow.
  * Continue developing internal tooling to aid in system monitoring
    and system management.
  * Continue integrating the PushWoosh Plugin.
  * PhoneGap 2.5.0 Integration. We will be skipping 2.4.0.

## Current plans for after March 25th:

  - Continue adding service measures to update the community
      - Uptime/service status (Including the service status panel)
      - Getting a 24 hour response team for critical failures
      - Providing more timely updates via social media.


That concludes our status update for this week. Please note that plans
scheduled for the future may change and we may shuffle them according
to necessity or demand.

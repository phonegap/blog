As part of our continued integration with the expanding ecosystem of Adobe's
Creative Cloud we now require all PhoneGap Build users to link their accounts
to an Adobe ID.

Creating and linking an Adobe ID is easy and can be accomplished by clicking
the "Connect an Adobe ID" button on your Settings page.  Clicking the button
will walk you through creating an Adobe ID if you don't have one, or will allow
you to sign in with an existing Adobe ID.

We've added support for another plugin to Adobe® PhoneGap™ Build™ for iOS and Android --  Adobe® PhoneGap™ Build™ plugin for Google Analytics. And more are coming!

You can log events, variables and page hits to your Google Analytics account and evaluate them in your dashboard.

As with the [ChildBrowser](/blog/childbrowser-plugin) and [Barcode Scanner](/blog/barcodescanner-plugin), this is an [open-source plugin](https://github.com/bobeast/GAPlugin/)

For inclusion instructions, check out [the docs](/docs/plugins), and for the full JavaScript API, check out the [source readme](https://github.com/bobeast/GAPlugin/blob/master/README.md). Full instructions are provided therein. Also checkout the Example folder in the repo to see how it all fits together.

We're building out our plugin support based on plugin demand and plugin availability, and for this we lean heavily on our community. Want your plugin on Adobe® PhoneGap™ Build? Read [this guide](https://github.com/phonegap/build/blob/master/Plugins.md).

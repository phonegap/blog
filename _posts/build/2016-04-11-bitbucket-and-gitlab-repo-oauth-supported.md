Just a quick update, we have added the ability to link your PhoneGap Build account to an existing [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) account. This will allow you to build your private BitBucket or GitLab hosted repository without having to resort to insecure basic authentication (yes people are doing that!).

To link your account just go to your account settings page and click the BitBucket or GitLab buttons and you will be able to build private (and public) repositories from those services.

Please note this integration is with **bitbucket.org** and **gitlab.com** and does not include support for corporate hosted versions of these products.

As usual, if you have any questions, <a href="https://forums.adobe.com/community/phonegap/build">don't hesitate to post to the forum</a> or yell at me on twitter at @brettrudd.

We are pleased to announce the availability of a new PhoneGap Build feature called **User Submitted Plugins**.  This new feature allows you to submit plugins for public use on PhoneGap Build.  Any plugin may be submitted, and once approved, becomes available for the entire PhoneGap Build community to enjoy.

You can access this feature via the new **Plugins** link at the top of the PhoneGap Build web site.  Clicking on the link gives you 3 key pieces of functionality:
1. **Available Plugins:** A list of all plugins available on PhoneGap Build for use in your app.
2. **Submission Form:** A mechanism to submit your own plugin to become available to PhoneGap Build users.
3. **Status:** A list of your submitted plugins so you can track their approval status. 

To make it easier to use plugins, each plugin has a details page that provides a direct link to the plugin documentation.

To learn more about how to use and submit plugins, visit the plugins [documentation page](https://build.phonegap.com/docs/plugins).  We look forward to seeing what you have to share!
